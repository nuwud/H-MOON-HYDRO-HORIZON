13163,"Teaming with Microbes","2019-09-03 19:20:27","<b>A Gardener's Guide to the Soil Food Web</b><br>  by Jeff Lowenfels and Wayne Lewis  <br><br>  <b>Should be required reading for all serious gardeners.</b>  <br><br>  Smart gardeners know that soil is anything but an inert substance. Healthy soil is teeming with life not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants, and thus become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial substances, many of them toxic to humans as well as other forms of life. But there is an alternative to this vicious circle: to garden in a way that strengthens, rather than destroys, the soil food web the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. By eschewing jargon and overly technical language, the authors make the benefits of cultivating the soil food web available to a wide audience, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals.",simple,"[{""name"":""Books"",""slug"":""books""}]",24.95,,publish,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/teaming-with-microbes/,,hmh00001,,visible,no,instock,24.95,0,no,no,"Thanks you for your order!",1.00,0,0,0,in,yes,no,,,no,yes,no,yes,taxable,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/teaming_with_microbes.jpg,yes,0,0,a:0:{},standard,,,yes,yes,domestic,331,0.00,0,"hmh00008,hmh00005,hmh00003,hmh00007,hmh00009",,,[],"a:25:{s:4:""_sku"";a:1:{i:0;s:8:""hmh00001"";}s:11:""total_sales"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:11:""_tax_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""taxable"";}s:10:""_tax_class"";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"""";}s:13:""_manage_stock"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:11:""_backorders"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:18:""_sold_individually"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""yes"";}s:8:""_virtual"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:13:""_downloadable"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:15:""_download_limit"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_download_expiry"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:6:""_stock"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:13:""_stock_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""instock"";}s:18:""_wc_average_rating"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_wc_review_count"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_product_version"";a:1:{i:0;s:5:""3.7.0"";}s:12:""_wp_old_slug"";a:1:{i:0;s:24:""import-placeholder-for-1"";}s:14:""_regular_price"";a:1:{i:0;s:5:""24.95"";}s:7:""_weight"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""1"";}s:7:""_length"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:6:""_width"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:7:""_height"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:14:""_purchase_note"";a:1:{i:0;s:26:""Thanks you for your order!"";}s:13:""_thumbnail_id"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""872"";}s:6:""_price"";a:1:{i:0;s:5:""24.95"";}}",0,,0,closed,open
13164,"Just Right Xtra All Organic Potting Mix","2019-09-03 19:20:27","When the concept of mixing a product for our industry came into focus- we decided not to utilize peat moss because we did not want sphagnum impurities. Nor did we want inconstant results. - We were wary of our clients having to risk their crop growth performance due to widely ranging nutrient ratios in their soil mixes. Nor did we want our clients to experience any increase in the potential risk of dormant pests becoming active. Just Right Xtra was developed micro-bio-logically.  <br><br>  Through extensive microscopic exploration and the development of micro and macro porosity; which is conducive to healthy beneficial bacteria, and fungi; Just Right ensures the delivery of available nutrition to your plants. We've gone well beyond the basic delivery of the traditionally, considered, essential, 19 major, minor, and micro elements found in most plant nutrient regimes. We deliver you biodiversity and consider the importance of the 10s of thousands of biological species that our found naturally in pristine soil ecologies. Health-fully, functioning, soils have sponsor a symbiotic relationship with their photosynthesizing or solar energy gathering green plant partners; which are anchored by living roots in their respective, rhizospheres. Together they harmonize and become one in a tonic balance with Nature. It's important to get it Just Right! Our pitch fork is your tuning fork!  <br><br>  Now--here is the real truth about gardening with our microbial-ly diverse, sustainable, Just Right Xtra soil mix.  <br><br>  <b>""Bags of Biology™""</b>  <br><br>  <ul>  <li>1st -we use a Cocotek coconut coir, high quality, low sodium, media. This coir is the backbone to our more diverse and less compacted mix, allowing textural uniformity. Allowing Just Right to tailor make finer or coarser, fiber consistencies. This composite mix consists of millions of capillary micro-sponges per unit volume, that absorbs up to eight times the mixes oven dried weight in water. Our mix has a natural affinity to hold a 3 : 7 air to water stoichiometric ratio. Which assures you that Just Right will hold plant nutrition naturally until the microporosity releases oxygenated nutrient solution over extended periods allowing reduced watering frequency.</li>  <li>2nd we add Ancient Biology from Ancient Forest Alaskan Humus which is an ultra-pure, ultra-organic ""compilation"" resulting from a very gradual collaboration between Mother Nature and Father Time. The unique and highly prized, Alaska Humus is the byproduct of patients and good fortune, resulting from nearly 10,000 years of post ice-age, real-time, decomposition performed by the life processes of vast numbers and species of microbes throughout Alaska's annual cycles of long, dark winters and extremely daylight-intensive summers. Because of its incredible microbiological diversity (an estimated 35,000 species of bacteria and 5000 species of fungi) -- unlike manufactured commercial compost -there is a guaranteed absence of any human pathogens, synthetic chemical impurities from foreign residues.</li>  <li>3rd Our Earth worm castings from Cali are Vegan,. These are the best quality castings we have ever seen.</li>  <li>4th Diatomite (Diatomaceous Earth or ""DE"") is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of the fossilized remains of unicellular fresh water microbes known as Diatoms. Sedimentary stratification over the millennia has compressed the remnants of these diatoms. This aggregation creates one of the most effective growing media components, available. Diatomite consists of approximately 86% silica, 3% magnesium and 2% iron., with the remainder of its contents being mineral compounds; which are complementary to plant growth. All of these unique factors make Diatomite the definitive horticultural grade growing medium. High Silica Content - In nature, Silica is conducive to healthy plant and root development. Because Diatomite is 86% silica, your plants will receive a continual slow release of silica, assisting with the growth of healthier, more robust plants. Absorbency & Porosity - Diatomite is naturally very porous, and can hold 150% of its weight in water. The Silica Content, natural Absorbency, and Porous qualities result in a slow release of water and nutrients to your plants, contributing to higher yields and less watering frequency. Capillary Action & Lateral movement - The porosity of the Diatomite contributes to its ability to wick water. Diatomite causes water and its dissolved nutrients to move laterally throughout the medium, making Diatomite ideal for hydroponics. The media achieves an excellent air to water ratio in the pot. Proper aeration is a particularly important quality which helps gardeners avoid root rot.

Despite the low level of nutrients found in natural soil-based environments, plant growth nevertheless occurs because the smallest humic acids channel available nutrients directly into nearby vegetation. By accelerating nutrient absorption at the root boundary zone where minerals enter the plant, small particle sized humic acids optimize nutrient uptake in fast growing vegetation. Diamond Nectar™ applies the magic of the smallest available humic acids to nutrient rich hydroponic environments by grabbing these nutrient minerals and transporting them into plant roots for faster growth and higher yields.

To create an excellent nutrient, you need of course a precise formula. But this is not all! It also is very important that each element comes from different sources, and different salts. This is how they are made available at all times, in a form plants can absorb them. And we don't stop at that. We add in our bottle elements we could call ""bio-activators"", that are not directly nutrients for plants, but which improve their general health, help them better absorb their food, and better resist to pathogen and insect aggressions.  <br><br>  FloraDuo is a complete nutrient, especially designed for fast growing plants, with a marked difference between growth and flowering needs. It comes in 2 parts: FloraDuo Grow and FloraDuo Bloom. it to all regions, FloraDuo is highly concentrated : 4 ml/L are enough for a balanced and vigorous growth. Its price also is very attractive.  <br><br>  FloraDuo is economical and cost effective. FloraDuo is also user-friendly : by mixing 3 parts FloraDuo Grow with 1 part FloraDuo Bloom, you'll address all growth requirements. Then, by reversing these proportions (3 parts Bloom with 1 part Grow), you'll attend to all fl owering needs. FloraDuo guarantees a perfect balance between growing and flowering. You need nothing else for abundant and healthy yields. Like for all our nutrients, FloraDuo is an exhaustive formula: no need for complements to improve your plants diet.

13208,"B'Cuzz Bloom Stimulator","2019-09-03 19:21:12","Especially for the plant's blooming phase, Atami has developed the B'Cuzz Bloom Stimulator. B'Cuzz Bloom stimulator encourages flower cell production and increases the manufacture and transport of sugar molecules in the flower development. This will lead to big, dense flowers and great taste. In this way, quantity as well as quality will increase on the final product. This bloom additive will help push your plants into bloom and keep them there. When a vegetative plant takes in blooming cells through the root system, those blooming cells set off a chain reaction within your plant. Coupled with the lights being cut from 18 to 12 hours, your plants will have no choice but to stop growing and start producing fruits and vegetables. The continual use of these bloom additives will ensure your plants will stay on the right course. Stresses such as interrupted light cycles and temperature variations that come with cold mornings and inevitable power outages will be minimized with these products.

13213,"B'Cuzz Root Stimulator","2019-09-03 19:21:28","A good start is crucial for a successful crop. Therefore a fast growing root system is essential for the grower. Roots are necessary to the plant to provide a continuous supply of water, sugars, and mineral nutrients. The larger the root system, the more dynamically the plant can function and grow. B’Cuzz Root Stimulator will initiate an explosive root production. A cutting is an exact replica of the host or parent plant, however, a cutting is still a vegetative plant. It takes time to change the cutting's train of thought from growing to rooting. The rooting formula will supplement this change. B’Cuzz Root Stimulant solutions can be best used when soaking B’Cuzz Roxx Stonewool, in cloning systems, and for young plants, cuttings, or seedlings. B’cuzz Root Stimulator is an effective means to developing disease resistance for your young plants.

Oneness (5-9-4) is Humboldt Nutrients own unique blend of plant-based amino and organic acid chelates, concentrated in a solution with complex carbohydrates, macro and micro-nutrients; all of which are naturally found in healthy soil and vegetation. Oneness is the perfect solution for the beginning gardener, looking for experienced results. Formulated with over 30 proprietary natural chelates, Oneness assures that your fruits, vegetables, and herbs will receive adequate nutrition during the vegetative and flowering stages. Oneness is 100% bio-degradable and made with chelates derived only from natural sources, setting Oneness apart from the competing synthetic chelated one-part formulas.

<b>Mayan MicroZyme</b> is a 100% organic and ecologically safe bacterial-enzymatic complex with 24 species of soil microorganisms that will increase fertility while providing vital nutrients to all types of plants and crops.

<b>Mayan MicroZyme</b> (MMZ) mineralizes nutrients; produces nitrogen, natural antibiotics and plant growth hormones; regulates nitrogen; builds soil organic matter; suppresses soil and plant pathogens; and improves fertility, yields, and nutrient availability and uptake.

The micro-organisms in this concentrate are dormant with a long shelf life because of the micro-encapsulating solution. When the concentrate is diluted in water and aerated, the micro-encapsulation dissolves and the micro-organism populations become active and increase in number.

<b>DIRECTIONS:</b>

<b>STEP 1: FERMENTATION </b>

Dilute 2 fluid ounces of Mayan MicroZyme CONCENTRATE per gallon of NON-CHLORINATED water. Add 5 Tablespoons of molasses, sugar or complex carbohydrates to mixture for every 2 ounces of concentrate. Aerate/agitate for 3 to 7 days in a bucket, compost tea brewer, or reservoir. For shorter activation time, maintain water temperature at 80 degrees.

<b>STEP 2:</b> DILUTION RATES for APPLICATION

<b>SOIL:</b> Add 1 gallon of Mayan MicroZyme <b>fermented</b> mixture (step 1) to every 30 gallons in nutrient reservoir <b>OR undiluted fermented mixture</b> can be sprayed directly on the soil surface immediately preceding irrigation with fertilizers.

<b>HYDROPONIC:</b> Add 1 gallon of MMZ <b>fermented</b> mixture (step 1) to every 30 gallons of nutrient reservoir.

<b>HYDROPONIC EBB and FLOW SYSTEMS:</b> Add 2 mL of <b>straight concentrate</b> from bottle (DO NOT DILUTE) per gallon to the reservoir in the ebb and flow system.

<b>FOLIAR SPRAY:</b> As a mold and pathogenic preventative, spray <b>fermented</b> mixture (step 1) onto the leaves until runoff occurs. Be sure spraying device is clean. Apply once a week in vegetative stage and first two weeks in bloom.

The role of the stomata’s is to catch nutrients and moisture from above.

Applying foliar prays is an additional way to get food into the plant, by passing the root zone and directly feeding the plant. High performance nutrients are expensive and no-one likes to see them go to waste. The state of the art binding agents present in Humboldt Sticky create a microscopic bond between your plant’s leaves and your nutrient solution, using all-natural biochemical processes which do not damage plant tissue, nor induce plant stress.

With Humboldt Sticky your foliar sprays are fully utilized by the plant, eliminating waste or overfeeding. By equally distributing the heavier elements of your foliar spray (micro-nutrients, trace elements, etc) throughout the solution, your favorite plants receive more complete, healthy and useful nutrition.

13273,"Diatomite Hi-Silica 1/4""-5/8""M- size 40L","2019-09-03 19:24:17","<b>100% ORGANIC!</b>

<b>Diatomite (Diatomaceous Earth or ""DE"")</b> is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of the fossilized remains of unicellular fresh water plants known as <b>Diatoms</b>. Over the millennia the diatoms have been compressed to create one of the most effective growing mediums available. Diatomite consists of approximately 90% silicon dioxide, with the remainder of its contents being elemental minerals, which are essential for plant growth. All of these unique factors make Diatomite the definitive horticultural grade growing medium.

<b>High Silica Content</b> - Silica is essential for healthy plants and roots. Because diatomite is 90% silica, your plants will receive a slow release of silica resulting in healthier more robust plants.

<b>Absorbency &amp; Porosity</b> - Diatomite is naturally very porous, and can hold 150% of its weight in water. The Silica Content, natural Absorbency, and Porous qualities result in a slow release of water and nutrients to your plants, contributing to higher yields and less watering.

<b>Capillary Action &amp; Lateral Movement</b> - The porosity of the Diatomite contributes to its ability to draw water, while moving water and nutrients laterally throughout the medium, making Diatomite ideal for hydroponics.

The new hexagonal PowerGrower    &reg; incorporates numerous design inovations and is protected by several patents. It is 15 inches across the top and 15 inches tall and consists of a single growing chamber at the top with an integrated reservoir below. The unique hexagonal shape enables growers to place units close together when plants are small and then seperate them as the plants grow. A configuration of seven units placed together creates a high performance hydroponics growing area measuring 4 feet across. This efficient use of space resembles a high-density honeycomb. This big step forward in hydroponic system design will delight experienced growers as well as those new to hydroponics.    <br>   The PowerGrower  &reg; comes in two froms, complete or modular.

      <p> A series of WaterFarms can be interconnected with a controller supplying nutrient and water automatically to all the units. A 13 gallon master reservoir filled with fresh water and mild nutrient is positioned on top of the float-valve activated 8 gallon controller. As the plants draw nutrient from their individual reservoirs, the controller's level drops, causing the float valve in the controller to open and draw fresh nutrient from the master reservoir. The ideal nutrient level is maintained in all the interconnected units for days or even weeks. The Texas Controller handles up to 16 units.

Bacillus subtilis GB03 is gram-positive (spore producing), making it extremely persistent and able to withstand stressful conditions like heat, drought, and cold. Plantacillin's non-clogging, non-abrasive liquid formulation also includes a food source to ensure the survival of the GB03 once they are applied. Plantacillin is 100% natural, and contains no chemicals. What does this mean for you and your plants? Well, to start with, you'll get some secondary benefits that you wouldn't when using chemicals. For instance, it is a known fact that the use of chemical products will actually prune the roots of your plants. In stark contrast to chemical fungicides, Plantacillin actually encourages stronger, denser root mass and length! That is because Bacillus subtilis GB03 excretes auxin-like substances that encourage such growth. The product is also easy to use.

13868,"Green Air Genesis Calibration Solutions","2019-09-03 19:48:09","A whole family of solution to properly care and maintain your testers and meters.  <p>  <b>PH Buffers</b>  <p>  These solutions are used to calibrate pH meters to assure they are accurate and working properly. You should check your pH meter frequently because the properties of the meters membrane is constantly changing from normal use and aging. We recommend a two point calibration between 4.0 and 7.0 to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 4.0 and 7.0. Ask your dealer for PHB-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  <b>PH Electrode Storage Solutions</b>  <p>  Use to store your pH meter electrode between use. This solution is designed to keep your electrode sensing membrane and reference junction clean and unclogged and ready for use. Store you electrode directly in a small cup of solution or saturate a sponge in the cap of your meter for storage between use. This will prevent your permeable glass membrane from becoming dry and from mineral deposits clogging the surface. This solution is designed to equalize the osmotic pressure of the reference solution in your meter junction to keep the reference solution from seeping out and prematurely aging your meter. Should your electrode membrane dry out soak it in this solution for at least two hours before use. NEVER STORE AN ELECTRODE IN DISTILLED OR DEIONIZED WATER. Ask your dealer for Genesis ESS solution.  <p>  <b>TDS and EC Standards</b>  <p>  The Genesis Lab manufactures calibration standards for Total Dissolved Solids and Electrical Conductivity for the purpose of keeping your solution concentration meters reading properly. We recommend a two point calibration between 800 ppm tds (1200 uS) and 1300 ppm tds (2000 uS) to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 800 and 1300. Ask your dealer for PPM-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  Also available in 1500 ppm tds (2.14 mS at 0.7 conv.), 1413 uS, 5000uS, and 12.88 mS. Other values available upon request.  <p>  <b>Electrode and Probe Cleaning Solutions</b>  <p>  Used to clean meter tip. Works for both pH and conductivity meters. Comes as a two part A and B cleaning solution to remove both organic and inorganic deposits from meter sensors. Use monthly or as needed to refresh your meter and keep it working optimum.

13872,"PH / Calibration Solutions","2019-09-03 19:48:21","To maximize plant growth, the pH of your nutrients should be slightly acidic. Experienced growers consider the ideal pH for most crops to fall between 5.5 and 6.5. Users of General Hydroponics nutrient products generally do not experience problems maintaining the proper pH range because our formulas are pH buffered. However, some important exceptions do exist. Acid content can reach unacceptable levels when nutrient solutions are mixed with poor quality water, or when pH unstable media – such as rock wool or gravel products – are used, or when high plant growth rates destabilize the nutrient mix due to rapid nutrient absorption by the crop.

By slowly releasing silicon, humates, and organic rare earth minerals, Rare Earth allows a crystal matrix to develop within growing plant tissue that protects the plant from heat stress and nutrient extremes by generating a protective silicon shield. This also deters fungal disease and reduces susceptibility to insect damage by “hardening” the plant. Use Rare Earth by blending it with rooting media, and either top-dressing around the plant stem or adding it directly to nutrient solutions.",grouped,"[{""name"":""General Hydroponics"",""slug"":""general-hydroponics""}]",8.24,,publish,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/rare-earth/,,hmh00686,,visible,no,instock,,0,no,no,"Thanks you for your order!",,0,0,0,in,yes,no,,,no,no,no,yes,taxable,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-G.jpg,yes,0,0,a:0:{},standard,,,yes,yes,domestic,331,0.00,0,"hmh01937,hmh01555,hmh01154,hmh01949,hmh00037",,,[],"a:27:{s:4:""_sku"";a:1:{i:0;s:8:""hmh00686"";}s:11:""total_sales"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:11:""_tax_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""taxable"";}s:10:""_tax_class"";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"""";}s:13:""_manage_stock"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:11:""_backorders"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:18:""_sold_individually"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""yes"";}s:8:""_virtual"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:13:""_downloadable"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:15:""_download_limit"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_download_expiry"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:6:""_stock"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:13:""_stock_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""instock"";}s:18:""_wc_average_rating"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_wc_review_count"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_product_version"";a:1:{i:0;s:5:""3.7.0"";}s:12:""_wp_old_slug"";a:1:{i:0;s:26:""import-placeholder-for-686"";}s:9:""_children"";a:1:{i:0;s:42:""a:3:{i:0;i:13966;i:1;i:13968;i:2;i:13969;}"";}s:7:""_weight"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:7:""_length"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:6:""_width"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:7:""_height"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:14:""_purchase_note"";a:1:{i:0;s:26:""Thanks you for your order!"";}s:13:""_thumbnail_id"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""62"";}s:10:""_edit_lock"";a:1:{i:0;s:12:""1567718604:1"";}s:10:""_edit_last"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""1"";}s:6:""_price"";a:2:{i:0;s:4:""8.24"";i:1;s:2:""47"";}}",0,,0,closed,open

American Pride® offers a mixture of fast-acting nutrients and minerals to get your garden jumping, and slow-release natural food for the soil, such as earthworm castings, bat guano and cottonseed meal. Rose gardeners swear by it! It’s the perfect food for ornamental trees and shrubs, container gardens, and flowers and vegetables.

Many calcium-intensive plants, like lettuce and tomatoes, need that extra Ca+ boost to optimize growth. This prevents diseases related to calcium deficiency like blossom-end rot (a disease that causes the bottom of fruits to rot on the vine). CALiMAGic™ also prevents leaf tip burn: drying and curling leaves due to a shortage of calcium in leaf tissue. Calcium deficiency affects a huge range of plants but can easily be remedied with a little CALiMAGic™!    CALiMAGic™ is a clean, fully soluble product that will not clog spray lines or drip emitters and is safe to use in reservoirs combined with many other fertilizers.

Designed similar to the famous Trimpro Rotors, although a little smaller, the economical machine is perfect for the smaller grower that needs a great trimmer at an affordable price. The smaller size makes the trimmer very portable. The hand crank operates a system of gears that enables the fingers that rotate the product at a slower speed than the trimming blades spinning below. This results in complete speed control. With the adjustable blade height, you can customize the final product to match your specifications. Minimum effort is needed to operate the trimmer.

14814,"Aphrodite's Extraction","2019-09-03 20:28:51","Aphrodite’s Extraction provides a rich blend of sucrose, fructose, chelated nutrients, vitamins, and organic acids to promote a thriving microbial population and strong, healthy plant growth. In addition to calcium, microbes need carbon in order to manufacture complex proteins for normal growth and reproduction: low carbon equals low microbial activity. Sucrose is one of the most available forms of carbon for a plant. When sucrose and fructose are blended with proteins, it becomes a microbial feast. Nutrients in Aphrodite’s Extraction are chelated to increase availability to the plant, promoting photosynthesis, structured soils, and increases in disease resistance and yields.

This blend provides organic acids necessary for enzymatic activity, and a complete balance of vitamins A, C, D, E, B1, B6 and B12, which are essential to plants’ biological growth processes. Additionally, carbon in the soil determines the magnitude of the Earth’s magnetic field’s effect on plants. Greater carbon presence results in greater magnetic influence, which leads to a faster life cycle.

TIP: Customers who use Aphrodite’s Extraction have experienced dramatic flavor improvements when applying it in the last weeks of the plants life cycle. The addition of sugar based calcium allows the plant to process more sugars to improve its ability to procreate. Try using Aphrodite’s Extraction as a food source for compost tea brewing. The blend of proteins, organic acids and sugar from carbon make an excellent food source for a microbial rich tea.",grouped,"[{""name"":""Nectar For The Gods"",""slug"":""nectar-for-the-gods""}]",22,,publish,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/aphrodites-extraction/,,hmh01371,,visible,no,instock,,0,no,no,"Thanks you for your order!",,12,12,12,in,yes,no,,,no,no,no,yes,taxable,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Aphrodite.jpg,yes,0,0,a:0:{},standard,,,yes,yes,domestic,331,0.00,0,"hmh01393,hmh01404,hmh01407,hmh01397,hmh01412",,,[],"a:27:{s:4:""_sku"";a:1:{i:0;s:8:""hmh01371"";}s:11:""total_sales"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:11:""_tax_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""taxable"";}s:10:""_tax_class"";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"""";}s:13:""_manage_stock"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:11:""_backorders"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:18:""_sold_individually"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""yes"";}s:8:""_virtual"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:13:""_downloadable"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:15:""_download_limit"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_download_expiry"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:6:""_stock"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:13:""_stock_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""instock"";}s:18:""_wc_average_rating"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_wc_review_count"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_product_version"";a:1:{i:0;s:5:""3.7.0"";}s:12:""_wp_old_slug"";a:1:{i:0;s:27:""import-placeholder-for-1371"";}s:9:""_children"";a:1:{i:0;s:30:""a:2:{i:0;i:14815;i:1;i:14817;}"";}s:7:""_weight"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:7:""_length"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:6:""_width"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:7:""_height"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:14:""_purchase_note"";a:1:{i:0;s:26:""Thanks you for your order!"";}s:13:""_thumbnail_id"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""156"";}s:10:""_edit_lock"";a:1:{i:0;s:12:""1567573193:1"";}s:10:""_edit_last"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""1"";}s:6:""_price"";a:2:{i:0;s:2:""22"";i:1;s:2:""45"";}}",0,,0,closed,open

Athena’s Aminas provides a readily available source of amino acids to optimize protein production and allow for maximum growth rates. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are the basic components of living cells. If not readily available, amino acids can be a limiting factor in growth rates. Plants use amino acids present in the soil, and synthesize them from elements sourced from soil, air, and water. However, plants can generally use more amino acids than they can find or synthesize in their natural environment. If amino acids are not abundant, plant growth slows necessarily to match availability of the most limiting factors. By adding an amino acid source, you enable your plants to build proteins as quickly as they are able.

Because the nutrients are fully chelated, Bloom Khaos improves plant health and vigor while reducing stress at crucial times of the plants’ life cycle, such as: transplanting, flower transition, and prior to taking cuttings.

This digestion process is the beginning step in the absorption of vitamins, acids and minerals by the plant. Gaia Mania has the ability to feed plants immediately, and is also designed to promote microbial populations in your medium, offering greater protection to plants’ root systems. All of the nitrogen in this product is protein based. This is the healthiest form of nitrogen for plants, promoting strong, healthy growth without a tendency toward elongation as with sodium based nitrates. Plants grow healthiest when they are grown with proteins, organic acids, and calcium based products.

Herculean Harvest increases the availability of calcium and phosphorus to your plants and soil, producing a wide range of benefits to plant health, structure and flavor, contributing to a vigorous soil food web and improving accessibility of nutrients. The active ingredient in bone meal, calcium phosphate, helps to carry all nutrients to the plant, except for nitrogen and potassium. Calcium is essential for supplying plant growth energy in order to sustain life and growth, and promotes solid stems through stronger cell development. Calcium also increases the cation exchange capacity of soils, making nutrients more available to microbial activity and ultimately to the plant.

This combined with a reflector yield of 92%,  makes the Panda the most energy-producing system currently available in the market.  <li>There are two litz wires at the two ends of the lamp. These have to be clamped in order to obtain a connection.   <p>  In the BADBOY 1000 Watt Ballast, the voltage supply to the lamp holder is disconnected when the lamp is opened. When pushing shut the  lamp holder, a metal clamp grips the litz wire.   <p>Our lamp is therefore shock-hazard-protected.The reflector is a remote with 15`  cord set.   <li>This makes the annual cleaning of the reflectors a very simple operation.

These crucial ingredients are used in abundance by plants in their fruiting or flowering cycle and the extra levels provided by Ionic® PK Boost can lead to larger flowers and greatly increased fruit and vegetable yields.    <p>Ionic® PK Boost is also designed to replenish the mineral levels that are usually in short supply in hydroponic reservoirs.

15143,"E-Papillon 1000W-240V DEC 24-31","2019-09-03 20:43:19","<p>E-Papillon 1000W  <p>Electronics and assimilation lighting has been a topic of discussion and debate for a long time now. A perfect solution is now available. Papillon luminaires - incorporating the highly reliable Greenvision electronics from Philips:  <p> the E-Papillon 1000 Watt.The E-Papillon offers many advantages over conventional luminaires. Quite simply, it uses less energy to produce more light. The E-Papillon enables energy-savings of around 5% - a substantial saving in your energy costs. Furthermore, the specially developed lamps also produce more light. This combined with a reflector yield of 92%, makes the E-Papillon the most energy-friendly fitting currently available in the market.  <p>Lights Interaction has developed a specific lamp holder for the 1000W luminaire in collaboration with Vosloh Schwabe. The lamp in the luminaire cannot be screwed into the normal E40 lamp holder of a conventional luminaire.  <li> There are two litz wires at the two ends of the lamp. These have to be clamped in order to obtain a connection.  <li> In the E-Papillon 1000W, the voltage supply to the lamp holder is disconnected when the lamp is opened. When pushing shut the lamp holder, a metal clamp grips the litz wire. Our lamp is therefore shock-hazard-protected.  <p>The reflector can be easily placed on and removed from the luminaire. This makes the annual cleaning of the reflectors a very simple operation. If you wish to replace the reflector later on, you can easily remove it from the safety cover and only replace the reflector.  Lights Interaction has consciously chosen this safety cover to avoid dirt accumulation on the top of our reflector. If dirt combines with water on top of the reflector, it may find its way into the reflector through chinks in the reflector. This will lead to streaks of dirt, whereby less light will be reflected.

Papillon fittings with reliable Greenvision electronics from Philips: the E-Papillon.  <p>The E-Papillon has many advantages compared with conventional fittings.  <p>Basically it comes down to the fact that with less energy, more growth light can be made.  <li>Namely, the E-Papillon causes an energy saving of about 5%, so a substantial saving on your energy costs.  <li>Also, more light comes out of the specially developed lamps. Together with a reflector yield of 92%,   <p>this means that the E-Papillon is the most energy-saving fitting that is available at the moment.   <li>The open Reflector Concept Lights Interaction's patented reflectors have a yield of 95% (measured in a laboratory certified by the British Standardisation Institute).   <li>Using a completely different production process, Lights Interaction is able to use a reflector material of a high surface density and ultra-high reflection capacity.  <p> The reflector is designed to reduce the ‘heating-up’ of the lamp to the minimum possible extent. As a result, there is a lower drop in the light output of the lamp in the course of its life. In short, our reflector produces more light (light output of 95%- Light Output Ratio), a broader beam of growth light that penetrates deeper into the plant and lower lamp luminosity rate thanks to a relatively low reflector temperature  <p> The values achieved by these reflectors are as much as 10% higher than conventional reflectors, resulting in more PAR light to the canopy while trapping considerably less heat, which is allowed to rise away from the canopy more efficiently.",grouped,"[{""name"":""Electronic Ballast"",""slug"":""electronic-ballast""}]",319,,publish,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/e-papillon-600-watt-240v-w-lamp/,,hmh01632,,visible,no,instock,,0,no,no,"Thanks you for your order!",,12,12,12,in,yes,no,,,no,no,no,yes,taxable,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/e-papillon-600w.jpg,yes,0,0,a:0:{},standard,,,yes,yes,domestic,331,0.00,0,"hmh01736,hmh01509,hmh01620,hmh01925,hmh01365",,,[],"a:27:{s:4:""_sku"";a:1:{i:0;s:8:""hmh01632"";}s:11:""total_sales"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:11:""_tax_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""taxable"";}s:10:""_tax_class"";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"""";}s:13:""_manage_stock"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:11:""_backorders"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:18:""_sold_individually"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""yes"";}s:8:""_virtual"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:13:""_downloadable"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:15:""_download_limit"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_download_expiry"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:6:""_stock"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:13:""_stock_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""instock"";}s:18:""_wc_average_rating"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_wc_review_count"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_product_version"";a:1:{i:0;s:5:""3.7.0"";}s:12:""_wp_old_slug"";a:1:{i:0;s:27:""import-placeholder-for-1632"";}s:9:""_children"";a:1:{i:0;s:18:""a:1:{i:0;i:15160;}"";}s:7:""_weight"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:7:""_length"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:6:""_width"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:7:""_height"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:14:""_purchase_note"";a:1:{i:0;s:26:""Thanks you for your order!"";}s:13:""_thumbnail_id"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""342"";}s:10:""_edit_lock"";a:1:{i:0;s:12:""1567740619:1"";}s:10:""_edit_last"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""1"";}s:6:""_price"";a:2:{i:0;s:3:""319"";i:1;s:3:""319"";}}",0,,0,closed,open

15215,"Pure Clean Natural Enzymes","2019-09-03 20:46:16","<p>Pure Clean Powerful natural enzymes    <li>Pure Clean is a soil and rhizosphere improver based on natural enzymes.   <p>This product allows for the accelerated decomposition of dead plant materials, which then releases extra nutrients and stimulates substrate life. Pure Clean also increases aerobic capacity and protects plants against diseases. This means that negative disease causing pathogens are proactively eliminated through the use of these special enzymes.  Pure Clean is suspended in a specific sucrose based solution.  <p> This sugar is essential to the health and quality of the enzymes. Uniquely, this carbohydrate based solution will NOT increase negative microbial activity. Instead, the enzymes are able to go to work immediately in the contaminated system and help “purify and clean” the rhizosphere  <p>Why use Pure Clean  <li>Healthy rhizosphere throughout vegetative and blooming phases.  <li>Protects against the buildup of harmful salts and waste compounds.  <li>Increases aerobic capacity in the root system.  <li>Reduces the risk of infection from soil borne diseases.  <li>(3) Specific enzyme profiles: cellulase, beta-glucanase, and pectinase.  <p>How to use Pure Clean  <p>Shake well before use. Add up to 4 ML per GAL of water or nutrient solution. Do NOT use with Green Sensation as an overabundance of enzymes is more costly.  Tip: Pure Clean may be used to rejuvenate depleted or diseased growing substrates. Remove as much plant matter i.e. roots, leaves, stems, etc. from the substrate as possible.

15306,"Clonex Root Maximizer - Granular/ for soil applications","2019-09-03 20:50:08","<p>Clonex Root Maximizer - Granular/ for soil applications  <p><b>This product is designed to be used in a soil system as a dry application. Endomycorrhizae have been shown to benefit over 90% of all plants.  <p>The Clonex brand; including Clonex Gel, Clonex Clone Solution and Clonex Mist, has been the world leader in plant propagation for nearly 30 years with billions of clones successfully rooted.  <p>Clonex Root Maximizer is the newest addition to the Clonex family and is the result of over a decade of dedicated research into mycorrhiza, the specialized beneficial root fungus that assists in the absorption of minerals and water from the soil.  <p>Mycorrhizae actually increase the surface area of plant roots, which allows the plant to reach nutrients and water that might not be available otherwise. Put simply, mycorrhizae extends the plant’s reach, allowing it to get to more of what it needs to survive. The fungus is actually a network of filaments that grow in and around the plant root cells, forming a mass that extends considerably beyond the plant’s root system. This makes the plant stronger and more resistant to stress. Mycorrhizae even protect their host plant against unwanted pathogens.  Clonex Root Maximizer puts life into your soil by adding bountiful amounts of mycorrhizae fungi, beneficial bacteria and Trichoderma that combine to improve the health and vitality of plants.  <li>Treating your young plants with Clonex Root Maximizer will give them the head start needed to reach their genetic potential leading to better quality and higher yields.  <p>Directions for Use  <li>For Transplants: Apply product directly in contact with plant roots. For larger plants (3 gallon pots and larger) apply 2 tablespoons (30ml) per plant. For smaller plants (less than 3 gallon pots), apply 1 teaspoon (5ml) per plant.  <li>For Planting Seeds: Apply product in the furrow beneath the seed at the rate of 1 tablespoon (15ml) per row foot, or broadcast at the rate of 2 tablespoons (30ml) per square foot and rake into the upper soil layer before planting.  <p>Storage  <p>Store in a cool dry place with prolonged temperatures not exceeding 90 F (32.2 C).   <li>Avoid direct sunlight.  <li>Product should be used in a well-ventilated place.  <p>GRANULAR/Soil-Soiless  <li>Glomus intraradices.........104 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus deserticola...........9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus etunicatum...........9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus clarum................. 9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus claroideum...........9 propagules/gm   <li>Gigaspora albida...............9 propagules/gm  <li>Trichoderma harzianum....145,000 CFU/gm  <li>Bacillus brevis...................98,000 CFU/gm  <li>Bacillus subtilis.................115,000 CFU/gm",grouped,"[{""name"":""Ionic Products"",""slug"":""ionic-products""}]",28.95,,publish,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/clonex-root-maximizer-granular-for-soil-applications/,,hmh01748,,visible,no,instock,,0,no,no,"Thanks you for your order!",,12,12,12,in,yes,no,,,no,no,no,yes,taxable,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RootMaxGroupGranular.jpg,yes,0,0,a:0:{},standard,,,yes,yes,domestic,331,0.00,0,"hmh01609,hmh01615,hmh01611,hmh01601,hmh01751",,,[],"a:27:{s:4:""_sku"";a:1:{i:0;s:8:""hmh01748"";}s:11:""total_sales"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:11:""_tax_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""taxable"";}s:10:""_tax_class"";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"""";}s:13:""_manage_stock"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:11:""_backorders"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:18:""_sold_individually"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""yes"";}s:8:""_virtual"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:13:""_downloadable"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:15:""_download_limit"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_download_expiry"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:6:""_stock"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:13:""_stock_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""instock"";}s:18:""_wc_average_rating"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_wc_review_count"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_product_version"";a:1:{i:0;s:5:""3.7.0"";}s:12:""_wp_old_slug"";a:1:{i:0;s:29:""import-placeholder-for-1748-2"";}s:9:""_children"";a:1:{i:0;s:42:""a:3:{i:0;i:15307;i:1;i:15308;i:2;i:15313;}"";}s:7:""_weight"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:7:""_length"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:6:""_width"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:7:""_height"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:14:""_purchase_note"";a:1:{i:0;s:26:""Thanks you for your order!"";}s:13:""_thumbnail_id"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""760"";}s:10:""_edit_lock"";a:1:{i:0;s:12:""1567704238:1"";}s:10:""_edit_last"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""1"";}s:6:""_price"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""28.95"";i:1;s:2:""85"";}}",0,,0,closed,open

This makes the plant stronger and more resistant to stress.   <p>Mycorrhizae even protect their host plant against unwanted pathogens.   <p>Soluble   •Glomus intraradices...........80 propagules/gm   •Glomus deserticola............5 propagules/gm   •Glomus etunicatum............5 propagules/gm   •Glomus clarum...................5 propagules/gm   •Glomus claroideum............5 propagules/gm   •Glomus mosseae...............5 propagules/gm   •Gigaspora albida................5 propagules/gm   •Trichoderma harzianum.....145,000 CFU/gm   •Bacillus brevis.....................98,000 CFU/gm   <p>Clonex Root Maximizer puts life into your hydro system by adding bountiful amounts of mycorrhizae fungi, beneficial bacteria and Trichoderma that combine to improve the health and vitality of plants.   <li>Treating your young plants with Clonex Root Maximizer will give them the head start needed to reach their genetic potential leading to better quality and higher yields.",grouped,"[{""name"":""Ionic Products"",""slug"":""ionic-products""}]",28.95,,publish,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/clonex-root-maximizer-mycorrhizae-soluble-for-hydro/,,hmh01751,,visible,no,instock,,0,no,no,"Thanks you for your order!",,12,12,12,in,yes,no,,,no,no,no,yes,taxable,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RootMaxGroupSoluble.jpg,yes,0,0,a:0:{},standard,,,yes,yes,domestic,331,0.00,0,"hmh01748,hmh01615,hmh01605,hmh01601,hmh01609",,,[],"a:27:{s:4:""_sku"";a:1:{i:0;s:8:""hmh01751"";}s:11:""total_sales"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:11:""_tax_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""taxable"";}s:10:""_tax_class"";a:1:{i:0;s:0:"""";}s:13:""_manage_stock"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:11:""_backorders"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:18:""_sold_individually"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""yes"";}s:8:""_virtual"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:13:""_downloadable"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""no"";}s:15:""_download_limit"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_download_expiry"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:6:""_stock"";a:1:{i:0;N;}s:13:""_stock_status"";a:1:{i:0;s:7:""instock"";}s:18:""_wc_average_rating"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_wc_review_count"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:16:""_product_version"";a:1:{i:0;s:5:""3.7.0"";}s:12:""_wp_old_slug"";a:1:{i:0;s:27:""import-placeholder-for-1751"";}s:9:""_children"";a:1:{i:0;s:42:""a:3:{i:0;i:15313;i:1;i:15312;i:2;i:15310;}"";}s:7:""_weight"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""0"";}s:7:""_length"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:6:""_width"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:7:""_height"";a:1:{i:0;s:2:""12"";}s:14:""_purchase_note"";a:1:{i:0;s:26:""Thanks you for your order!"";}s:13:""_thumbnail_id"";a:1:{i:0;s:3:""761"";}s:10:""_edit_lock"";a:1:{i:0;s:12:""1567704242:1"";}s:10:""_edit_last"";a:1:{i:0;s:1:""1"";}s:6:""_price"";a:2:{i:0;s:5:""28.95"";i:1;s:2:""85"";}}",0,,0,closed,open
