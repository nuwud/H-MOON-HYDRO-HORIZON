13163,"Teaming with Microbes","<b>A Gardener's Guide to the Soil Food Web</b><br>  by Jeff Lowenfels and Wayne Lewis  <br><br>  <b>Should be required reading for all serious gardeners.</b>  <br><br>  Smart gardeners know that soil is anything but an inert substance. Healthy soil is teeming with life not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants, and thus become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial substances, many of them toxic to humans as well as other forms of life. But there is an alternative to this vicious circle: to garden in a way that strengthens, rather than destroys, the soil food web the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. By eschewing jargon and overly technical language, the authors make the benefits of cultivating the soil food web available to a wide audience, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals.",,"September 3, 2019",product,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/teaming-with-microbes/
13164,"Just Right Xtra All Organic Potting Mix","When the concept of mixing a product for our industry came into focus- we decided not to utilize peat moss because we did not want sphagnum impurities. Nor did we want inconstant results. - We were wary of our clients having to risk their crop growth performance due to widely ranging nutrient ratios in their soil mixes. Nor did we want our clients to experience any increase in the potential risk of dormant pests becoming active. Just Right Xtra was developed micro-bio-logically.  <br><br>  Through extensive microscopic exploration and the development of micro and macro porosity; which is conducive to healthy beneficial bacteria, and fungi; Just Right ensures the delivery of available nutrition to your plants. We've gone well beyond the basic delivery of the traditionally, considered, essential, 19 major, minor, and micro elements found in most plant nutrient regimes. We deliver you biodiversity and consider the importance of the 10s of thousands of biological species that our found naturally in pristine soil ecologies. Health-fully, functioning, soils have sponsor a symbiotic relationship with their photosynthesizing or solar energy gathering green plant partners; which are anchored by living roots in their respective, rhizospheres. Together they harmonize and become one in a tonic balance with Nature. It's important to get it Just Right! Our pitch fork is your tuning fork!  <br><br>  Now--here is the real truth about gardening with our microbial-ly diverse, sustainable, Just Right Xtra soil mix.  <br><br>  <b>""Bags of Biology™""</b>  <br><br>  <ul>  <li>1st -we use a Cocotek coconut coir, high quality, low sodium, media. This coir is the backbone to our more diverse and less compacted mix, allowing textural uniformity. Allowing Just Right to tailor make finer or coarser, fiber consistencies. This composite mix consists of millions of capillary micro-sponges per unit volume, that absorbs up to eight times the mixes oven dried weight in water. Our mix has a natural affinity to hold a 3 : 7 air to water stoichiometric ratio. Which assures you that Just Right will hold plant nutrition naturally until the microporosity releases oxygenated nutrient solution over extended periods allowing reduced watering frequency.</li>  <li>2nd we add Ancient Biology from Ancient Forest Alaskan Humus which is an ultra-pure, ultra-organic ""compilation"" resulting from a very gradual collaboration between Mother Nature and Father Time. The unique and highly prized, Alaska Humus is the byproduct of patients and good fortune, resulting from nearly 10,000 years of post ice-age, real-time, decomposition performed by the life processes of vast numbers and species of microbes throughout Alaska's annual cycles of long, dark winters and extremely daylight-intensive summers. Because of its incredible microbiological diversity (an estimated 35,000 species of bacteria and 5000 species of fungi) -- unlike manufactured commercial compost -there is a guaranteed absence of any human pathogens, synthetic chemical impurities from foreign residues.</li>  <li>3rd Our Earth worm castings from Cali are Vegan,. These are the best quality castings we have ever seen.</li>  <li>4th Diatomite (Diatomaceous Earth or ""DE"") is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of the fossilized remains of unicellular fresh water microbes known as Diatoms. Sedimentary stratification over the millennia has compressed the remnants of these diatoms. This aggregation creates one of the most effective growing media components, available. Diatomite consists of approximately 86% silica, 3% magnesium and 2% iron., with the remainder of its contents being mineral compounds; which are complementary to plant growth. All of these unique factors make Diatomite the definitive horticultural grade growing medium. High Silica Content - In nature, Silica is conducive to healthy plant and root development. Because Diatomite is 86% silica, your plants will receive a continual slow release of silica, assisting with the growth of healthier, more robust plants. Absorbency & Porosity - Diatomite is naturally very porous, and can hold 150% of its weight in water. The Silica Content, natural Absorbency, and Porous qualities result in a slow release of water and nutrients to your plants, contributing to higher yields and less watering frequency. Capillary Action & Lateral movement - The porosity of the Diatomite contributes to its ability to wick water. Diatomite causes water and its dissolved nutrients to move laterally throughout the medium, making Diatomite ideal for hydroponics. The media achieves an excellent air to water ratio in the pot. Proper aeration is a particularly important quality which helps gardeners avoid root rot.

13285,PowerGrower,"<i>Hydroponic Drip System</i>  <p>  Air driven hydroponic modules have dramatically evolved since our introduction of the original AquaFarm in 1976. The new hexagonal PowerGrower    &reg; incorporates numerous design inovations and is protected by several patents. It is 15 inches across the top and 15 inches tall and consists of a single growing chamber at the top with an integrated reservoir below. The unique hexagonal shape enables growers to place units close together when plants are small and then seperate them as the plants grow. A configuration of seven units placed together creates a high performance hydroponics growing area measuring 4 feet across. This efficient use of space resembles a high-density honeycomb. This big step forward in hydroponic system design will delight experienced growers as well as those new to hydroponics.    <br>   The PowerGrower  &reg; comes in two froms, complete or modular.

You should check your pH meter frequently because the properties of the meters membrane is constantly changing from normal use and aging. We recommend a two point calibration between 4.0 and 7.0 to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 4.0 and 7.0. Ask your dealer for PHB-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  <b>PH Electrode Storage Solutions</b>  <p>  Use to store your pH meter electrode between use. This solution is designed to keep your electrode sensing membrane and reference junction clean and unclogged and ready for use. Store you electrode directly in a small cup of solution or saturate a sponge in the cap of your meter for storage between use. This will prevent your permeable glass membrane from becoming dry and from mineral deposits clogging the surface. This solution is designed to equalize the osmotic pressure of the reference solution in your meter junction to keep the reference solution from seeping out and prematurely aging your meter. Should your electrode membrane dry out soak it in this solution for at least two hours before use. NEVER STORE AN ELECTRODE IN DISTILLED OR DEIONIZED WATER. Ask your dealer for Genesis ESS solution.  <p>  <b>TDS and EC Standards</b>  <p>  The Genesis Lab manufactures calibration standards for Total Dissolved Solids and Electrical Conductivity for the purpose of keeping your solution concentration meters reading properly. We recommend a two point calibration between 800 ppm tds (1200 uS) and 1300 ppm tds (2000 uS) to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale.

13872,"PH / Calibration Solutions","To maximize plant growth, the pH of your nutrients should be slightly acidic. Experienced growers consider the ideal pH for most crops to fall between 5.5 and 6.5. Users of General Hydroponics nutrient products generally do not experience problems maintaining the proper pH range because our formulas are pH buffered. However, some important exceptions do exist. Acid content can reach unacceptable levels when nutrient solutions are mixed with poor quality water, or when pH unstable media – such as rock wool or gravel products – are used, or when high plant growth rates destabilize the nutrient mix due to rapid nutrient absorption by the crop.

Calcium deficiency affects a huge range of plants but can easily be remedied with a little CALiMAGic™!

14814,"Aphrodite's Extraction","Aphrodite’s Extraction provides a rich blend of sucrose, fructose, chelated nutrients, vitamins, and organic acids to promote a thriving microbial population and strong, healthy plant growth. In addition to calcium, microbes need carbon in order to manufacture complex proteins for normal growth and reproduction: low carbon equals low microbial activity. Sucrose is one of the most available forms of carbon for a plant. When sucrose and fructose are blended with proteins, it becomes a microbial feast. Nutrients in Aphrodite’s Extraction are chelated to increase availability to the plant, promoting photosynthesis, structured soils, and increases in disease resistance and yields.

This blend provides organic acids necessary for enzymatic activity, and a complete balance of vitamins A, C, D, E, B1, B6 and B12, which are essential to plants’ biological growth processes. Additionally, carbon in the soil determines the magnitude of the Earth’s magnetic field’s effect on plants. Greater carbon presence results in greater magnetic influence, which leads to a faster life cycle.

TIP: Customers who use Aphrodite’s Extraction have experienced dramatic flavor improvements when applying it in the last weeks of the plants life cycle. The addition of sugar based calcium allows the plant to process more sugars to improve its ability to procreate. Try using Aphrodite’s Extraction as a food source for compost tea brewing. The blend of proteins, organic acids and sugar from carbon make an excellent food source for a microbial rich tea.",,"September 3, 2019",product,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/aphrodites-extraction/

14818,"Athena's Aminas","<p>Every plant needs certain compounds for growth beyond soil, light, water, and CO2. Athena’s Aminas provides a readily available source of amino acids to optimize protein production and allow for maximum growth rates. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are the basic components of living cells. If not readily available, amino acids can be a limiting factor in growth rates. Plants use amino acids present in the soil, and synthesize them from elements sourced from soil, air, and water. However, plants can generally use more amino acids than they can find or synthesize in their natural environment. If amino acids are not abundant, plant growth slows necessarily to match availability of the most limiting factors. By adding an amino acid source, you enable your plants to build proteins as quickly as they are able. When using Athena’s Aminas, you can expect to see faster, healthier growth, resulting in bigger, more vigorous plants and a greater ability to resist pests and disease.</p>  <p>Also known as Amino Blast by Harvest Moon Organics.</p>",,"September 3, 2019",product,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/athenas-aminas/

Iron and silica levels are quite good and should make a positive contribution to plant nutrition. Both total and water soluble silica levels are very good, making this product a suitable growing media. There are no heavy metal contaminate cancers with the use of this product. Maidenwell Diatomite is a rich source of plant available silica which is widely documented to stimulate self acquired resistance (SAR) in plants thereby increasing their resistance to disease.  Diatomite consists of skeletal remains of microscopic single cell aquatic plants known as diatoms.

These pucks will emit Co2 lasting for 1 day each and are required to be added every day from weeks 2-5 of the blooming cycle. The benefits of co2 are not obtained unless there is a rise in Co2 to 1100-1400ppm range and it must be done everyday for the main part of the bloom cycle. Otherwise you won't get the results you are looking for with Co2 enrichment, which in most cases is 40-60% increase in harvest</p>  <ul>  <li> Each puck will supply Co2 to 440 square foot area for up to 18 hours, emitting approx 1600ppm of Co2 into your grow space</li>  <li>Place in a container (bucket or plastic milk jug with top cut off). Add 100ml of water to start the reaction & place container 3 ft from plants,up near the canopy. Remember Co2 is heavier than air and will sink</li>  <li>Start the puck 1 hour after the lights come on to ensure proper opening of the plant stomata</li>  <li>Use 1 puck per day from week 2 thru week 5 of bloom/flowering cycle</li></ul>",,"September 3, 2019",product,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/excellofizz-co2-puck/

A perfect solution is now available. Papillon luminaires - incorporating the highly reliable Greenvision electronics from Philips:  <p> the E-Papillon 1000 Watt.The E-Papillon offers many advantages over conventional luminaires. Quite simply, it uses less energy to produce more light. The E-Papillon enables energy-savings of around 5% - a substantial saving in your energy costs. Furthermore, the specially developed lamps also produce more light. This combined with a reflector yield of 92%, makes the E-Papillon the most energy-friendly fitting currently available in the market.  <p>Lights Interaction has developed a specific lamp holder for the 1000W luminaire in collaboration with Vosloh Schwabe. The lamp in the luminaire cannot be screwed into the normal E40 lamp holder of a conventional luminaire.  <li> There are two litz wires at the two ends of the lamp. These have to be clamped in order to obtain a connection.  <li> In the E-Papillon 1000W, the voltage supply to the lamp holder is disconnected when the lamp is opened. When pushing shut the lamp holder, a metal clamp grips the litz wire. Our lamp is therefore shock-hazard-protected.  <p>The reflector can be easily placed on and removed from the luminaire. This makes the annual cleaning of the reflectors a very simple operation. If you wish to replace the reflector later on, you can easily remove it from the safety cover and only replace the reflector.  Lights Interaction has consciously chosen this safety cover to avoid dirt accumulation on the top of our reflector. If dirt combines with water on top of the reflector, it may find its way into the reflector through chinks in the reflector. This will lead to streaks of dirt, whereby less light will be reflected. When cleaning the fitting, the cleaning water would also be soiled immediately on contact with the accumulated dirt on top of the reflector.",,"September 3, 2019",product,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/e-papillon-1000w-240v-dec-24-31/

Pure Clean also increases aerobic capacity and protects plants against diseases. This means that negative disease causing pathogens are proactively eliminated through the use of these special enzymes.  Pure Clean is suspended in a specific sucrose based solution.  <p> This sugar is essential to the health and quality of the enzymes. Uniquely, this carbohydrate based solution will NOT increase negative microbial activity. Instead, the enzymes are able to go to work immediately in the contaminated system and help “purify and clean” the rhizosphere  <p>Why use Pure Clean  <li>Healthy rhizosphere throughout vegetative and blooming phases.  <li>Protects against the buildup of harmful salts and waste compounds.  <li>Increases aerobic capacity in the root system.  <li>Reduces the risk of infection from soil borne diseases.  <li>(3) Specific enzyme profiles: cellulase, beta-glucanase, and pectinase.  <p>How to use Pure Clean  <p>Shake well before use. Add up to 4 ML per GAL of water or nutrient solution. Do NOT use with Green Sensation as an overabundance of enzymes is more costly.  Tip: Pure Clean may be used to rejuvenate depleted or diseased growing substrates. Remove as much plant matter i.e. roots, leaves, stems, etc. from the substrate as possible. Saturate the used growing media at a rate of up to 16 ML per GAL of clean water.

This product enhances the production of chlorophyll and increases essential oil and brix levels in the plant. The result allows aromatic and flavor profiles of blooms, flowers and fruits to be significantly enhanced.  <p>One signature aspect of the amino acid profile contained in Royal Rush is a significant reduction in the overall flowering cycle to harvest. This effect is created by signaling to the plant system that environmental stress is incurring, and as a protective effort the plant must increase essential oil and resin content on the plant surface in order to protect itself. Healthy plants that boast vigorous development in optimal conditions may reduce overall production time by as much as one week!  <p>Why use Royal Rush  <li>Increase and enhance the overall essential oil and brix content.  <li>Promotes more essential element availability to the plant  <li>Stimulates chlorophyll production within the plant  <li>Shortens the production cycle thus increasing the amounts of harvests annually.",,"September 3, 2019",product,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/plagron-royal-rush/

Endomycorrhizae have been shown to benefit over 90% of all plants.  <p>The Clonex brand; including Clonex Gel, Clonex Clone Solution and Clonex Mist, has been the world leader in plant propagation for nearly 30 years with billions of clones successfully rooted.  <p>Clonex Root Maximizer is the newest addition to the Clonex family and is the result of over a decade of dedicated research into mycorrhiza, the specialized beneficial root fungus that assists in the absorption of minerals and water from the soil.  <p>Mycorrhizae actually increase the surface area of plant roots, which allows the plant to reach nutrients and water that might not be available otherwise. Put simply, mycorrhizae extends the plant’s reach, allowing it to get to more of what it needs to survive. The fungus is actually a network of filaments that grow in and around the plant root cells, forming a mass that extends considerably beyond the plant’s root system. This makes the plant stronger and more resistant to stress. Mycorrhizae even protect their host plant against unwanted pathogens.  Clonex Root Maximizer puts life into your soil by adding bountiful amounts of mycorrhizae fungi, beneficial bacteria and Trichoderma that combine to improve the health and vitality of plants.  <li>Treating your young plants with Clonex Root Maximizer will give them the head start needed to reach their genetic potential leading to better quality and higher yields.  <p>Directions for Use  <li>For Transplants: Apply product directly in contact with plant roots. For larger plants (3 gallon pots and larger) apply 2 tablespoons (30ml) per plant. For smaller plants (less than 3 gallon pots), apply 1 teaspoon (5ml) per plant.  <li>For Planting Seeds: Apply product in the furrow beneath the seed at the rate of 1 tablespoon (15ml) per row foot, or broadcast at the rate of 2 tablespoons (30ml) per square foot and rake into the upper soil layer before planting.  <p>Storage  <p>Store in a cool dry place with prolonged temperatures not exceeding 90 F (32.2 C).   <li>Avoid direct sunlight.  <li>Product should be used in a well-ventilated place.  <p>GRANULAR/Soil-Soiless  <li>Glomus intraradices.........104 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus deserticola...........9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus etunicatum...........9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus clarum................. 9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus claroideum...........9 propagules/gm   <li>Gigaspora albida...............9 propagules/gm  <li>Trichoderma harzianum....145,000 CFU/gm  <li>Bacillus brevis...................98,000 CFU/gm  <li>Bacillus subtilis.................115,000 CFU/gm",,"September 3, 2019",product,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/product/clonex-root-maximizer-granular-for-soil-applications/
