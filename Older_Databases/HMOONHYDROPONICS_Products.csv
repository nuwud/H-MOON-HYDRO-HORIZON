,,,Teaming with Microbes,1,0,visible,,"<b>A Gardener's Guide to the Soil Food Web</b><br>  by Jeff Lowenfels and Wayne Lewis  <br><br>  <b>Should be required reading for all serious gardeners.</b>  <br><br>  Smart gardeners know that soil is anything but an inert substance. Healthy soil is teeming with life not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants, and thus become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial substances, many of them toxic to humans as well as other forms of life. But there is an alternative to this vicious circle: to garden in a way that strengthens, rather than destroys, the soil food web the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. By eschewing jargon and overly technical language, the authors make the benefits of cultivating the soil food web available to a wide audience, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals.",,,taxable,standard,1,notify,1,1,0,0,0,0,Thank you for your purchase!,24.95,24.95,100,Books,,,,,,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/teaming_with_microbes.jpg,,,,,,,,,
,,,Just Right Xtra All Organic Potting Mix,1,0,visible,,"When the concept of mixing a product for our industry came into focus- we decided not to utilize peat moss because we did not want sphagnum impurities. Nor did we want inconstant results. - We were wary of our clients having to risk their crop growth performance due to widely ranging nutrient ratios in their soil mixes. Nor did we want our clients to experience any increase in the potential risk of dormant pests becoming active. Just Right Xtra was developed micro-bio-logically.  <br><br>  Through extensive microscopic exploration and the development of micro and macro porosity; which is conducive to healthy beneficial bacteria, and fungi; Just Right ensures the delivery of available nutrition to your plants. We've gone well beyond the basic delivery of the traditionally, considered, essential, 19 major, minor, and micro elements found in most plant nutrient regimes. We deliver you biodiversity and consider the importance of the 10s of thousands of biological species that our found naturally in pristine soil ecologies. Health-fully, functioning, soils have sponsor a symbiotic relationship with their photosynthesizing or solar energy gathering green plant partners; which are anchored by living roots in their respective, rhizospheres. Together they harmonize and become one in a tonic balance with Nature. It's important to get it Just Right! Our pitch fork is your tuning fork!  <br><br>  Now--here is the real truth about gardening with our microbial-ly diverse, sustainable, Just Right Xtra soil mix.  <br><br>  <b>""Bags of Biologyâ„¢""</b>  <br><br>  <ul>  <li>1st -we use a Cocotek coconut coir, high quality, low sodium, media. This coir is the backbone to our more diverse and less compacted mix, allowing textural uniformity. Allowing Just Right to tailor make finer or coarser, fiber consistencies. This composite mix consists of millions of capillary micro-sponges per unit volume, that absorbs up to eight times the mixes oven dried weight in water. Our mix has a natural affinity to hold a 3 : 7 air to water stoichiometric ratio. Which assures you that Just Right will hold plant nutrition naturally until the microporosity releases oxygenated nutrient solution over extended periods allowing reduced watering frequency.</li>  <li>2nd we add Ancient Biology from Ancient Forest Alaskan Humus which is an ultra-pure, ultra-organic ""compilation"" resulting from a very gradual collaboration between Mother Nature and Father Time. The unique and highly prized, Alaska Humus is the byproduct of patients and good fortune, resulting from nearly 10,000 years of post ice-age, real-time, decomposition performed by the life processes of vast numbers and species of microbes throughout Alaska's annual cycles of long, dark winters and extremely daylight-intensive summers. Because of its incredible microbiological diversity (an estimated 35,000 species of bacteria and 5000 species of fungi) -- unlike manufactured commercial compost -there is a guaranteed absence of any human pathogens, synthetic chemical impurities from foreign residues.</li>  <li>3rd Our Earth worm castings from Cali are Vegan,. These are the best quality castings we have ever seen.</li>  <li>4th Diatomite (Diatomaceous Earth or ""DE"") is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of the fossilized remains of unicellular fresh water microbes known as Diatoms. Sedimentary stratification over the millennia has compressed the remnants of these diatoms. This aggregation creates one of the most effective growing media components, available. Diatomite consists of approximately 86% silica, 3% magnesium and 2% iron., with the remainder of its contents being mineral compounds; which are complementary to plant growth. All of these unique factors make Diatomite the definitive horticultural grade growing medium. High Silica Content - In nature, Silica is conducive to healthy plant and root development. Because Diatomite is 86% silica, your plants will receive a continual slow release of silica, assisting with the growth of healthier, more robust plants. Absorbency & Porosity - Diatomite is naturally very porous, and can hold 150% of its weight in water. The Silica Content, natural Absorbency, and Porous qualities result in a slow release of water and nutrients to your plants, contributing to higher yields and less watering frequency. Capillary Action & Lateral movement - The porosity of the Diatomite contributes to its ability to wick water. Diatomite causes water and its dissolved nutrients to move laterally throughout the medium, making Diatomite ideal for hydroponics. The media achieves an excellent air to water ratio in the pot. Proper aeration is a particularly important quality which helps gardeners avoid root rot. Silica stone can be used as a beneficial supplement to expanded clay, Rockwool, coco peat, and other mediums depending on the application.</li>  <li>Next Subculture M: a mycorhizae root inoculant that contains a wide diversity of endo and ecto mycorrhizal fungi that colonize plant roots. Subculture M allows for known beneficial fungi to find a place to reside around the root zones of plants.</li>  <li>Now Subculture B: is a probiotic inoculum of beneficial microorganisms that will help increase the vitality and yield in all plants. Microbes in Subculture B will attach themselves to root zones dramatically affecting plant performance in positive ways.</li>  </ul>  <br><br>  Natural Organic Sulfate of Potash is natural potash mineral contains 51 percent potash 18 percent sulfur. It also contains trace amounts of calcium and magnesium. Potassium is frequently the most abundant Major element in plant nutrition.  <br><br>  Organic Bone Char contains more than 16% available phosphate (P2O5) and 32% total phosphate.  <br><br>  Rare Earth: is derived from ancient seabed deposits of prophylactic clay that is blended with fulvate ore.  <br><br>  Our ph in this mix is 7.01 which are perfect to keep the bacteria and fungi from destroying or decomposing. There is no need for adjustment of your pH of any nutrient you add to this mix.  <br><br>  We suggest no nutrients for a couple weeks. When you wet this mix with dechlorinated water the runoff will be around 1300ppm which is hot and will aid in Germination of any seeds or cuttings.  <br><br>  We recommend use of the General Organics and the Flora blend Compost tea.  <br><br>  The feed chart for the new General Organics line should be followed after week 1 of just water.  <br><br>  Adjusting pH is not necessary with any nutrients - please use organics.  <br><br>  Please plant a Row of the Hungry -for you local food bank call 1-877-492-2727 to find out how we can help!  <p>  ***THIS ITEM DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR FREE SHIPPING***",,,taxable,standard,1,notify,1,30,28,20,6,0,Thank you for your purchase!,15.95,15.95,10000,Growing Medium,,,,,,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/just_right_xtra.jpg,,,,,,,,,Nickel City Garden Supply

Bust<br>  (5.5x8.5"", 96 pages, illustrated, index)  <br><br>  This is the book to have if you've ever wondered about unlocking your plant's maximum potential with Carbon Dioxide. If you're not familiar with it, here's the basic rundown on it. There is about 300 PPM's (Parts Per Millionth) of Carbon Dioxide in the regular air we breathe day to day. If you add 3 to 5 times the CO2 to the controlled environment in an indoor garden, (around 900-1200 ppm's), most plants will benefit greatly. Greenhouses worldwide report 30-40% better yields from fruit and vegetable crops by increasing the CO2 levels. It's the reason talking to plants is so good for them, we exhale Carbon Dioxide. There are many ways to introduce it into your growroom, and there are things to know to get the most for your gas. It can be quickly wasted if your room is leaky, have inadequate ventilation, or add CO2 at the wrong times.

To create an excellent nutrient, you need of course a precise formula. But this is not all! It also is very important that each element comes from different sources, and different salts. This is how they are made available at all times, in a form plants can absorb them. And we don't stop at that. We add in our bottle elements we could call ""bio-activators"", that are not directly nutrients for plants, but which improve their general health, help them better absorb their food, and better resist to pathogen and insect aggressions.  <br><br>  FloraDuo is a complete nutrient, especially designed for fast growing plants, with a marked difference between growth and flowering needs. It comes in 2 parts: FloraDuo Grow and FloraDuo Bloom. it to all regions, FloraDuo is highly concentrated : 4 ml/L are enough for a balanced and vigorous growth. Its price also is very attractive.  <br><br>  FloraDuo is economical and cost effective. FloraDuo is also user-friendly : by mixing 3 parts FloraDuo Grow with 1 part FloraDuo Bloom, you'll address all growth requirements. Then, by reversing these proportions (3 parts Bloom with 1 part Grow), you'll attend to all fl owering needs. FloraDuo guarantees a perfect balance between growing and flowering. You need nothing else for abundant and healthy yields. Like for all our nutrients, FloraDuo is an exhaustive formula: no need for complements to improve your plants diet.

You should check your pH meter frequently because the properties of the meters membrane is constantly changing from normal use and aging. We recommend a two point calibration between 4.0 and 7.0 to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 4.0 and 7.0. Ask your dealer for PHB-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  <b>PH Electrode Storage Solutions</b>  <p>  Use to store your pH meter electrode between use. This solution is designed to keep your electrode sensing membrane and reference junction clean and unclogged and ready for use. Store you electrode directly in a small cup of solution or saturate a sponge in the cap of your meter for storage between use. This will prevent your permeable glass membrane from becoming dry and from mineral deposits clogging the surface. This solution is designed to equalize the osmotic pressure of the reference solution in your meter junction to keep the reference solution from seeping out and prematurely aging your meter. Should your electrode membrane dry out soak it in this solution for at least two hours before use. NEVER STORE AN ELECTRODE IN DISTILLED OR DEIONIZED WATER. Ask your dealer for Genesis ESS solution.  <p>  <b>TDS and EC Standards</b>  <p>  The Genesis Lab manufactures calibration standards for Total Dissolved Solids and Electrical Conductivity for the purpose of keeping your solution concentration meters reading properly. We recommend a two point calibration between 800 ppm tds (1200 uS) and 1300 ppm tds (2000 uS) to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 800 and 1300. Ask your dealer for PPM-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  Also available in 1500 ppm tds (2.14 mS at 0.7 conv.), 1413 uS, 5000uS, and 12.88 mS.

,,,Aphrodite's Extraction,1,0,visible,,"<p>Aphroditeâ€™s Extraction provides a rich blend of sucrose, fructose, chelated nutrients, vitamins, and organic acids to promote a thriving microbial population and strong, healthy plant growth. In addition to calcium, microbes need carbon in order to manufacture complex proteins for normal growth and reproduction: low carbon equals low microbial activity. Sucrose is one of the most available forms of carbon for a plant. When sucrose and fructose are blended with proteins, it becomes a microbial feast. Nutrients in Aphroditeâ€™s Extraction are chelated to increase availability to the plant, promoting photosynthesis, structured soils, and increases in disease resistance and yields. </p>  <p>This blend provides organic acids necessary for enzymatic activity, and a complete balance of vitamins A, C, D, E, B1, B6 and B12, which are essential to plantsâ€™ biological growth processes. Additionally, carbon in the soil determines the magnitude of the Earthâ€™s magnetic fieldâ€™s effect on plants. Greater carbon presence results in greater magnetic influence, which leads to a faster life cycle.</p>  <p>TIP: Customers who use Aphroditeâ€™s Extraction have experienced dramatic flavor improvements when applying it in the last weeks of the plants life cycle. The addition of sugar based calcium allows the plant to process more sugars to improve its ability to procreate. Try using Aphroditeâ€™s Extraction as a food source for compost tea brewing.

,,,Athena's Aminas,1,0,visible,,"<p>Every plant needs certain compounds for growth beyond soil, light, water, and CO2. Athenaâ€™s Aminas provides a readily available source of amino acids to optimize protein production and allow for maximum growth rates. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are the basic components of living cells. If not readily available, amino acids can be a limiting factor in growth rates. Plants use amino acids present in the soil, and synthesize them from elements sourced from soil, air, and water. However, plants can generally use more amino acids than they can find or synthesize in their natural environment. If amino acids are not abundant, plant growth slows necessarily to match availability of the most limiting factors. By adding an amino acid source, you enable your plants to build proteins as quickly as they are able.

,,,E-Papillon 1000W-240V DEC 24-31,1,0,visible,,"<p>E-Papillon 1000W  <p>Electronics and assimilation lighting has been a topic of discussion and debate for a long time now. A perfect solution is now available. Papillon luminaires - incorporating the highly reliable Greenvision electronics from Philips:  <p> the E-Papillon 1000 Watt.The E-Papillon offers many advantages over conventional luminaires. Quite simply, it uses less energy to produce more light. The E-Papillon enables energy-savings of around 5% - a substantial saving in your energy costs. Furthermore, the specially developed lamps also produce more light. This combined with a reflector yield of 92%, makes the E-Papillon the most energy-friendly fitting currently available in the market.  <p>Lights Interaction has developed a specific lamp holder for the 1000W luminaire in collaboration with Vosloh Schwabe. The lamp in the luminaire cannot be screwed into the normal E40 lamp holder of a conventional luminaire.  <li> There are two litz wires at the two ends of the lamp. These have to be clamped in order to obtain a connection.  <li> In the E-Papillon 1000W, the voltage supply to the lamp holder is disconnected when the lamp is opened. When pushing shut the lamp holder, a metal clamp grips the litz wire. Our lamp is therefore shock-hazard-protected.  <p>The reflector can be easily placed on and removed from the luminaire. This makes the annual cleaning of the reflectors a very simple operation. If you wish to replace the reflector later on, you can easily remove it from the safety cover and only replace the reflector.  Lights Interaction has consciously chosen this safety cover to avoid dirt accumulation on the top of our reflector. If dirt combines with water on top of the reflector, it may find its way into the reflector through chinks in the reflector. This will lead to streaks of dirt, whereby less light will be reflected. When cleaning the fitting, the cleaning water would also be soiled immediately on contact with the accumulated dirt on top of the reflector.",,,taxable,standard,1,notify,1,0,12,12,12,0,Thank you for your purchase!,365,365,0,Grow Lights Ballast > Electronic Ballast,,,,,,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/e pap.jpg,,,,,,,,,UNO

,,,E-Papillon 600 Watt 240V. W / Lamp,1,0,visible,,"<p>E-Papillon 600W 240  <li>Electronics and assimilation lighting are subjects that have been discussed for a long time.  <li>So now thereâ€™s a perfect solution. Papillon fittings with reliable Greenvision electronics from Philips: the E-Papillon.  <p>The E-Papillon has many advantages compared with conventional fittings.  <p>Basically it comes down to the fact that with less energy, more growth light can be made.  <li>Namely, the E-Papillon causes an energy saving of about 5%, so a substantial saving on your energy costs.  <li>Also, more light comes out of the specially developed lamps. Together with a reflector yield of 92%,   <p>this means that the E-Papillon is the most energy-saving fitting that is available at the moment.   <li>The open Reflector Concept Lights Interaction's patented reflectors have a yield of 95% (measured in a laboratory certified by the British Standardisation Institute).   <li>Using a completely different production process, Lights Interaction is able to use a reflector material of a high surface density and ultra-high reflection capacity.  <p> The reflector is designed to reduce the â€˜heating-upâ€™ of the lamp to the minimum possible extent. As a result, there is a lower drop in the light output of the lamp in the course of its life. In short, our reflector produces more light (light output of 95%- Light Output Ratio), a broader beam of growth light that penetrates deeper into the plant and lower lamp luminosity rate thanks to a relatively low reflector temperature  <p> The values achieved by these reflectors are as much as 10% higher than conventional reflectors, resulting in more PAR light to the canopy while trapping considerably less heat, which is allowed to rise away from the canopy more efficiently.",,,taxable,standard,1,notify,1,0,12,12,12,0,Thank you for your purchase!,0,0,0,Grow Lights Ballast > Electronic Ballast,,,,,,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/e-papillon 600w.jpg,,,,,,,,,UNO

,,,Prue Clean natural enzymes,1,0,visible,,"<p>Pure Clean Powerful natural enzymes    <li>Pure Clean is a soil and rhizosphere improver based on natural enzymes.   <p>This product allows for the accelerated decomposition of dead plant materials, which then releases extra nutrients and stimulates substrate life. Pure Clean also increases aerobic capacity and protects plants against diseases. This means that negative disease causing pathogens are proactively eliminated through the use of these special enzymes.  Pure Clean is suspended in a specific sucrose based solution.  <p> This sugar is essential to the health and quality of the enzymes. Uniquely, this carbohydrate based solution will NOT increase negative microbial activity. Instead, the enzymes are able to go to work immediately in the contaminated system and help â€œpurify and cleanâ€ the rhizosphere  <p>Why use Pure Clean  <li>Healthy rhizosphere throughout vegetative and blooming phases.  <li>Protects against the buildup of harmful salts and waste compounds.  <li>Increases aerobic capacity in the root system.  <li>Reduces the risk of infection from soil borne diseases.  <li>(3) Specific enzyme profiles: cellulase, beta-glucanase, and pectinase.  <p>How to use Pure Clean  <p>Shake well before use. Add up to 4 ML per GAL of water or nutrient solution. Do NOT use with Green Sensation as an overabundance of enzymes is more costly.  Tip: Pure Clean may be used to rejuvenate depleted or diseased growing substrates. Remove as much plant matter i.e. roots, leaves, stems, etc. from the substrate as possible. Saturate the used growing media at a rate of up to 16 ML per GAL of clean water.

The result allows aromatic and flavor profiles of blooms, flowers and fruits to be significantly enhanced.  <p>One signature aspect of the amino acid profile contained in Royal Rush is a significant reduction in the overall flowering cycle to harvest. This effect is created by signaling to the plant system that environmental stress is incurring, and as a protective effort the plant must increase essential oil and resin content on the plant surface in order to protect itself. Healthy plants that boast vigorous development in optimal conditions may reduce overall production time by as much as one week!  <p>Why use Royal Rush  <li>Increase and enhance the overall essential oil and brix content.  <li>Promotes more essential element availability to the plant  <li>Stimulates chlorophyll production within the plant  <li>Shortens the production cycle thus increasing the amounts of harvests annually.",,,taxable,standard,1,notify,1,0,12,12,12,0,Thank you for your purchase!,0,0,0,Nutrients & Supplements > plagron,,,,,,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-008-Royal-Rush.jpg,,,,,,,,,

Endomycorrhizae have been shown to benefit over 90% of all plants.  <p>The Clonex brand; including Clonex Gel, Clonex Clone Solution and Clonex Mist, has been the world leader in plant propagation for nearly 30 years with billions of clones successfully rooted.  <p>Clonex Root Maximizer is the newest addition to the Clonex family and is the result of over a decade of dedicated research into mycorrhiza, the specialized beneficial root fungus that assists in the absorption of minerals and water from the soil.  <p>Mycorrhizae actually increase the surface area of plant roots, which allows the plant to reach nutrients and water that might not be available otherwise. Put simply, mycorrhizae extends the plantâ€™s reach, allowing it to get to more of what it needs to survive. The fungus is actually a network of filaments that grow in and around the plant root cells, forming a mass that extends considerably beyond the plantâ€™s root system. This makes the plant stronger and more resistant to stress. Mycorrhizae even protect their host plant against unwanted pathogens.  Clonex Root Maximizer puts life into your soil by adding bountiful amounts of mycorrhizae fungi, beneficial bacteria and Trichoderma that combine to improve the health and vitality of plants.  <li>Treating your young plants with Clonex Root Maximizer will give them the head start needed to reach their genetic potential leading to better quality and higher yields.  <p>Directions for Use  <li>For Transplants: Apply product directly in contact with plant roots. For larger plants (3 gallon pots and larger) apply 2 tablespoons (30ml) per plant. For smaller plants (less than 3 gallon pots), apply 1 teaspoon (5ml) per plant.  <li>For Planting Seeds: Apply product in the furrow beneath the seed at the rate of 1 tablespoon (15ml) per row foot, or broadcast at the rate of 2 tablespoons (30ml) per square foot and rake into the upper soil layer before planting.  <p>Storage  <p>Store in a cool dry place with prolonged temperatures not exceeding 90 F (32.2 C).   <li>Avoid direct sunlight.  <li>Product should be used in a well-ventilated place.  <p>GRANULAR/Soil-Soiless  <li>Glomus intraradices.........104 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus deserticola...........9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus etunicatum...........9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus clarum................. 9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus claroideum...........9 propagules/gm   <li>Gigaspora albida...............9 propagules/gm  <li>Trichoderma harzianum....145,000 CFU/gm  <li>Bacillus brevis...................98,000 CFU/gm  <li>Bacillus subtilis.................115,000 CFU/gm",,,taxable,standard,1,notify,1,0,12,12,12,0,Thank you for your purchase!,0,0,0,Nutrients & Supplements > Ionic Products,,,,,,,http://hmoonhydroponics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RootMaxGroupGranular.jpg,,,,,,,,,Hydrodynamics
