Healthy soil is teeming with life not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants, and thus become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial substances, many of them toxic to humans as well as other forms of life. But there is an alternative to this vicious circle: to garden in a way that strengthens, rather than destroys, the soil food web the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. By eschewing jargon and overly technical language, the authors make the benefits of cultivating the soil food web available to a wide audience, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals.",,,taxable,standard,1,notify,1,1,0,0,0,0,Thanks you for your order!,,24.95,,Books,,domestic,,,,,teaming_with_microbes.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,simple,hmh00002,Just Right Xtra All Organic Potting Mix,1,0,visible,,"When the concept of mixing a product for our industry came into focus- we decided not to utilize peat moss because we did not want sphagnum impurities. Nor did we want inconstant results. - We were wary of our clients having to risk their crop growth performance due to widely ranging nutrient ratios in their soil mixes. Nor did we want our clients to experience any increase in the potential risk of dormant pests becoming active. Just Right Xtra was developed micro-bio-logically.  <br><br>  Through extensive microscopic exploration and the development of micro and macro porosity; which is conducive to healthy beneficial bacteria, and fungi; Just Right ensures the delivery of available nutrition to your plants. We've gone well beyond the basic delivery of the traditionally, considered, essential, 19 major, minor, and micro elements found in most plant nutrient regimes. We deliver you biodiversity and consider the importance of the 10s of thousands of biological species that our found naturally in pristine soil ecologies. Health-fully, functioning, soils have sponsor a symbiotic relationship with their photosynthesizing or solar energy gathering green plant partners; which are anchored by living roots in their respective, rhizospheres. Together they harmonize and become one in a tonic balance with Nature. It's important to get it Just Right! Our pitch fork is your tuning fork!  <br><br>  Now--here is the real truth about gardening with our microbial-ly diverse, sustainable, Just Right Xtra soil mix.  <br><br>  <b>""Bags of Biology™""</b>  <br><br>  <ul>  <li>1st -we use a Cocotek coconut coir, high quality, low sodium, media. This coir is the backbone to our more diverse and less compacted mix, allowing textural uniformity. Allowing Just Right to tailor make finer or coarser, fiber consistencies. This composite mix consists of millions of capillary micro-sponges per unit volume, that absorbs up to eight times the mixes oven dried weight in water. Our mix has a natural affinity to hold a 3 : 7 air to water stoichiometric ratio. Which assures you that Just Right will hold plant nutrition naturally until the microporosity releases oxygenated nutrient solution over extended periods allowing reduced watering frequency.</li>  <li>2nd we add Ancient Biology from Ancient Forest Alaskan Humus which is an ultra-pure, ultra-organic ""compilation"" resulting from a very gradual collaboration between Mother Nature and Father Time. The unique and highly prized, Alaska Humus is the byproduct of patients and good fortune, resulting from nearly 10,000 years of post ice-age, real-time, decomposition performed by the life processes of vast numbers and species of microbes throughout Alaska's annual cycles of long, dark winters and extremely daylight-intensive summers. Because of its incredible microbiological diversity (an estimated 35,000 species of bacteria and 5000 species of fungi) -- unlike manufactured commercial compost -there is a guaranteed absence of any human pathogens, synthetic chemical impurities from foreign residues.</li>  <li>3rd Our Earth worm castings from Cali are Vegan,. These are the best quality castings we have ever seen.</li>  <li>4th Diatomite (Diatomaceous Earth or ""DE"") is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of the fossilized remains of unicellular fresh water microbes known as Diatoms. Sedimentary stratification over the millennia has compressed the remnants of these diatoms. This aggregation creates one of the most effective growing media components, available. Diatomite consists of approximately 86% silica, 3% magnesium and 2% iron., with the remainder of its contents being mineral compounds; which are complementary to plant growth. All of these unique factors make Diatomite the definitive horticultural grade growing medium. High Silica Content - In nature, Silica is conducive to healthy plant and root development. Because Diatomite is 86% silica, your plants will receive a continual slow release of silica, assisting with the growth of healthier, more robust plants. Absorbency & Porosity - Diatomite is naturally very porous, and can hold 150% of its weight in water. The Silica Content, natural Absorbency, and Porous qualities result in a slow release of water and nutrients to your plants, contributing to higher yields and less watering frequency. Capillary Action & Lateral movement - The porosity of the Diatomite contributes to its ability to wick water. Diatomite causes water and its dissolved nutrients to move laterally throughout the medium, making Diatomite ideal for hydroponics. The media achieves an excellent air to water ratio in the pot. Proper aeration is a particularly important quality which helps gardeners avoid root rot.

If you're not familiar with it, here's the basic rundown on it. There is about 300 PPM's (Parts Per Millionth) of Carbon Dioxide in the regular air we breathe day to day. If you add 3 to 5 times the CO2 to the controlled environment in an indoor garden, (around 900-1200 ppm's), most plants will benefit greatly. Greenhouses worldwide report 30-40% better yields from fruit and vegetable crops by increasing the CO2 levels. It's the reason talking to plants is so good for them, we exhale Carbon Dioxide. There are many ways to introduce it into your growroom, and there are things to know to get the most for your gas. It can be quickly wasted if your room is leaky, have inadequate ventilation, or add CO2 at the wrong times.

To create an excellent nutrient, you need of course a precise formula. But this is not all! It also is very important that each element comes from different sources, and different salts. This is how they are made available at all times, in a form plants can absorb them. And we don't stop at that. We add in our bottle elements we could call ""bio-activators"", that are not directly nutrients for plants, but which improve their general health, help them better absorb their food, and better resist to pathogen and insect aggressions.  <br><br>  FloraDuo is a complete nutrient, especially designed for fast growing plants, with a marked difference between growth and flowering needs. It comes in 2 parts: FloraDuo Grow and FloraDuo Bloom. it to all regions, FloraDuo is highly concentrated : 4 ml/L are enough for a balanced and vigorous growth. Its price also is very attractive.  <br><br>  FloraDuo is economical and cost effective. FloraDuo is also user-friendly : by mixing 3 parts FloraDuo Grow with 1 part FloraDuo Bloom, you'll address all growth requirements. Then, by reversing these proportions (3 parts Bloom with 1 part Grow), you'll attend to all fl owering needs. FloraDuo guarantees a perfect balance between growing and flowering. You need nothing else for abundant and healthy yields. Like for all our nutrients, FloraDuo is an exhaustive formula: no need for complements to improve your plants diet.

You should check your pH meter frequently because the properties of the meters membrane is constantly changing from normal use and aging. We recommend a two point calibration between 4.0 and 7.0 to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 4.0 and 7.0. Ask your dealer for PHB-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  <b>PH Electrode Storage Solutions</b>  <p>  Use to store your pH meter electrode between use. This solution is designed to keep your electrode sensing membrane and reference junction clean and unclogged and ready for use. Store you electrode directly in a small cup of solution or saturate a sponge in the cap of your meter for storage between use. This will prevent your permeable glass membrane from becoming dry and from mineral deposits clogging the surface. This solution is designed to equalize the osmotic pressure of the reference solution in your meter junction to keep the reference solution from seeping out and prematurely aging your meter. Should your electrode membrane dry out soak it in this solution for at least two hours before use. NEVER STORE AN ELECTRODE IN DISTILLED OR DEIONIZED WATER. Ask your dealer for Genesis ESS solution.  <p>  <b>TDS and EC Standards</b>  <p>  The Genesis Lab manufactures calibration standards for Total Dissolved Solids and Electrical Conductivity for the purpose of keeping your solution concentration meters reading properly.

Sucrose is one of the most available forms of carbon for a plant. When sucrose and fructose are blended with proteins, it becomes a microbial feast.

A perfect solution is now available. Papillon luminaires - incorporating the highly reliable Greenvision electronics from Philips:  <p> the E-Papillon 1000 Watt.The E-Papillon offers many advantages over conventional luminaires. Quite simply, it uses less energy to produce more light. The E-Papillon enables energy-savings of around 5% - a substantial saving in your energy costs. Furthermore, the specially developed lamps also produce more light. This combined with a reflector yield of 92%, makes the E-Papillon the most energy-friendly fitting currently available in the market.  <p>Lights Interaction has developed a specific lamp holder for the 1000W luminaire in collaboration with Vosloh Schwabe. The lamp in the luminaire cannot be screwed into the normal E40 lamp holder of a conventional luminaire.  <li> There are two litz wires at the two ends of the lamp. These have to be clamped in order to obtain a connection.  <li> In the E-Papillon 1000W, the voltage supply to the lamp holder is disconnected when the lamp is opened. When pushing shut the lamp holder, a metal clamp grips the litz wire. Our lamp is therefore shock-hazard-protected.  <p>The reflector can be easily placed on and removed from the luminaire. This makes the annual cleaning of the reflectors a very simple operation. If you wish to replace the reflector later on, you can easily remove it from the safety cover and only replace the reflector.  Lights Interaction has consciously chosen this safety cover to avoid dirt accumulation on the top of our reflector. If dirt combines with water on top of the reflector, it may find its way into the reflector through chinks in the reflector. This will lead to streaks of dirt, whereby less light will be reflected. When cleaning the fitting, the cleaning water would also be soiled immediately on contact with the accumulated dirt on top of the reflector.",,,taxable,standard,1,notify,1,0,12,12,12,0,Thanks you for your order!,,365,,Grow Lights Ballast > Electronic Ballast,,domestic,,,,,e pap.jpg,,,,,,,,,UNO,,,,,,
