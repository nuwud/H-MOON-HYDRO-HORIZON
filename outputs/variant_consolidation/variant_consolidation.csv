<b>Mayan MicroZyme</b> is a 100% organic and ecologically safe bacterial-enzymatic complex with 24 species of soil microorganisms that will increase fertility while providing vital nutrients to all types of plants and crops.

<b>Mayan MicroZyme</b> (MMZ) mineralizes nutrients; produces nitrogen, natural antibiotics and plant growth hormones; regulates nitrogen; builds soil organic matter; suppresses soil and plant pathogens; and improves fertility, yields, and nutrient availability and uptake.

The micro-organisms in this concentrate are dormant with a long shelf life because of the micro-encapsulating solution. When the concentrate is diluted in water and aerated, the micro-encapsulation dissolves and the micro-organism populations become active and increase in number.

<b>DIRECTIONS:</b>

<b>STEP 1: FERMENTATION </b>

Dilute 2 fluid ounces of Mayan MicroZyme CONCENTRATE per gallon of NON-CHLORINATED water. Add 5 Tablespoons of molasses, sugar or complex carbohydrates to mixture for every 2 ounces of concentrate. Aerate/agitate for 3 to 7 days in a bucket, compost tea brewer, or reservoir. For shorter activation time, maintain water temperature at 80 degrees.

<b>STEP 2:</b> DILUTION RATES for APPLICATION

<b>SOIL:</b> Add 1 gallon of Mayan MicroZyme <b>fermented</b> mixture (step 1) to every 30 gallons in nutrient reservoir <b>OR undiluted fermented mixture</b> can be sprayed directly on the soil surface immediately preceding irrigation with fertilizers.

<b>HYDROPONIC:</b> Add 1 gallon of MMZ <b>fermented</b> mixture (step 1) to every 30 gallons of nutrient reservoir.

<b>HYDROPONIC EBB and FLOW SYSTEMS:</b> Add 2 mL of <b>straight concentrate</b> from bottle (DO NOT DILUTE) per gallon to the reservoir in the ebb and flow system.

<b>Myco Maximum</b> adds organic matter and contains nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and micronutrients necessary for plant health. Mycorrhizal fungi increase the surface-absorbing area of the roots from 10-10,000 times, greatly improving the ability of plants to grow, fruit, and flower by forming an intricate web that captures and assimilates nutrients and water for the plant.

Working together, beneficial bacteria, mycorrhizae, and <i>Trichoderma</i> fungi expand into the surrounding medium to greatly increase the roots' ability to absorb and recycle water and nutrients, improving transplant success, flowering, and plant health.

<b>DIRECTIONS</b>

The goal is to create physical contact between the roots and the inoculant. <b>Myco Maximum</b> can be banded under seed, worked into seed beds, placed under cuttings, blended into potting soil, or sprinkled near roots at transplant time. Some examples of inoculation practices and rates include:

<b>Planting:</b>
Apply in furrow 1 teaspoon per row-foot. Cuttings: 0.5 teaspoon under each cutting. Flower beds: Mix into top 4 inches of soil, 2 pounds per 100 square feet.

green-air-genesis-calibration-solutions,Green Air Genesis Calibration Solutions,grouped,active,2025-11-02 09:42:56,,H Moon Hydro,"A whole family of solution to properly care and maintain your testers and meters.  <p>  <b>PH Buffers</b>  <p>  These solutions are used to calibrate pH meters to assure they are accurate and working properly. You should check your pH meter frequently because the properties of the meters membrane is constantly changing from normal use and aging. We recommend a two point calibration between 4.0 and 7.0 to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 4.0 and 7.0. Ask your dealer for PHB-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  <b>PH Electrode Storage Solutions</b>  <p>  Use to store your pH meter electrode between use. This solution is designed to keep your electrode sensing membrane and reference junction clean and unclogged and ready for use. Store you electrode directly in a small cup of solution or saturate a sponge in the cap of your meter for storage between use. This will prevent your permeable glass membrane from becoming dry and from mineral deposits clogging the surface. This solution is designed to equalize the osmotic pressure of the reference solution in your meter junction to keep the reference solution from seeping out and prematurely aging your meter. Should your electrode membrane dry out soak it in this solution for at least two hours before use. NEVER STORE AN ELECTRODE IN DISTILLED OR DEIONIZED WATER. Ask your dealer for Genesis ESS solution.  <p>  <b>TDS and EC Standards</b>  <p>  The Genesis Lab manufactures calibration standards for Total Dissolved Solids and Electrical Conductivity for the purpose of keeping your solution concentration meters reading properly. We recommend a two point calibration between 800 ppm tds (1200 uS) and 1300 ppm tds (2000 uS) to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 800 and 1300. Ask your dealer for PPM-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  Also available in 1500 ppm tds (2.14 mS at 0.7 conv.), 1413 uS, 5000uS, and 12.88 mS.

In addition to calcium, microbes need carbon in order to manufacture complex proteins for normal growth and reproduction: low carbon equals low microbial activity. Sucrose is one of the most available forms of carbon for a plant. When sucrose and fructose are blended with proteins, it becomes a microbial feast. Nutrients in Aphrodite’s Extraction are chelated to increase availability to the plant, promoting photosynthesis, structured soils, and increases in disease resistance and yields.

This blend provides organic acids necessary for enzymatic activity, and a complete balance of vitamins A, C, D, E, B1, B6 and B12, which are essential to plants’ biological growth processes. Additionally, carbon in the soil determines the magnitude of the Earth’s magnetic field’s effect on plants. Greater carbon presence results in greater magnetic influence, which leads to a faster life cycle.

TIP: Customers who use Aphrodite’s Extraction have experienced dramatic flavor improvements when applying it in the last weeks of the plants life cycle.

Endomycorrhizae have been shown to benefit over 90% of all plants.  <p>The Clonex brand; including Clonex Gel, Clonex Clone Solution and Clonex Mist, has been the world leader in plant propagation for nearly 30 years with billions of clones successfully rooted.  <p>Clonex Root Maximizer is the newest addition to the Clonex family and is the result of over a decade of dedicated research into mycorrhiza, the specialized beneficial root fungus that assists in the absorption of minerals and water from the soil.  <p>Mycorrhizae actually increase the surface area of plant roots, which allows the plant to reach nutrients and water that might not be available otherwise.
