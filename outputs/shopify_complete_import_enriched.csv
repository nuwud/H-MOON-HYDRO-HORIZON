alfalfa-grease-extract-1000ml,ALFALFA GREASE extract 1000ml,"ALFALFA EXTRACT - YIELD Alfa Grease is a premium alfalfa extract that provides the natural hormone triacontanol. Triacontanol is a naturally occurring fatty alcohol derived from plant waxes, particularly found in high concentrations in the waxes of certain plant species, such as alfalfa, sugarcane, and rice bran. It is known for its potential beneficial effects on plant growth and development. Average yield increase of 20% consistently tested. Hormonal Regulation: Triacontanol can influence plant growth and development by modulating the levels and activities of plant hormones, such as auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, and abscisic acid. It can promote hormone synthesis, transport, and signal transduction pathways, which play crucial roles in regulating plant growth, flowering, fruiting, and other developmental processes. Photosynthetic Enhancement: One of the significant effects of triacontanol is its ability to enhance photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. Triacontanol has been reported to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis by promoting the activity of key enzymes involved in the process. This can lead to higher rates of carbon dioxide assimilation and energy production, ultimately contributing to better plant growth and development. Stress Tolerance: Triacontanol has been found to enhance the ability of plants to withstand various environmental stresses. It can help improve the plant's tolerance to abiotic stresses like drought, heat, cold, salinity, and heavy metal toxicity. Triacontanol activates stress-responsive genes and antioxidant systems in plants, providing protection against oxidative damage and maintaining cellular homeostasis under stressful conditions. Yield and Quality Improvement: Studies have shown that triacontanol application can result in increased crop yield and improved quality characteristics. It has been found to enhance fruit set, increase the number and size of flowers and fruits, improve seed germination and seedling vigor, and enhance nutrient uptake and utilization efficiency. These effects can lead to higher crop productivity and improved marketable traits of agricultural produce. Environmental Sustainability: Triacontanol is considered an environmentally friendly option for plant growth enhancement as it is a naturally occurring compound. It can be used as an alternative to synthetic growth regulators or chemical fertilizers, reducing reliance on synthetic inputs and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. This is a beneficial substance to plants. Hormone products consisting of a mixture of plant hormones, plant nutrients, inoculants, or soil amendments is not a “plant regulator” under section 2(v) of FIFRA, provided it meets the following criteria of low toxicity under 3 and 4 and product is not intended for use on food crop sites.

green-wash-label-500ml,GREEN wash Label 500ml,"GREEN LABEL - CANNA PLANT WASH Canna Building Blocks The Green Label is a gem for the industrial production of the plant. It is harnessing the principles of biomimicry at its finest. Spray GREASE™ Green Label in veg and especially in flower. It is amazing to have a safe alternative to spray in flower that will not leave foreign oils or residues of any kind. All GREASE™ products are free from pesticide residuals, heavy metals or residual solvents. We recommend drenching as well, as it is a proven soil conditioner. Grease, Green Label bridges the gap and harnesses the building blocks of Canna resins back on the Canna plant itself. All Grease Label products work to increase resin, but when you align the source material with the target crop, the efficiency goes up resulting in the maximum yield of unique and targeted compounds. A natural plant wash, also known as a plant-based wash or organic wash, is an alternative to traditional chemical pesticides and can be used to remove dust and debris from the plants prior to harvesting. This is a first of its kind, new to the industry technology. Here are some benefits of using a natural Canna plant wash: Pesticide-Free: Natural plant washes are made from botanical extracts and essential oils derived from plants. They do not contain synthetic chemicals or harmful pesticides, making them a safer and more environmentally friendly option for cultivation of the plant. Residue Removal: Plants can accumulate dust, dirt, and other debris on their leaves and buds during the growing process. A natural plant wash helps remove these residues effectively, leaving the plants clean and free from contaminants. This can improve the appearance, quality, and overall cleanliness of the harvested buds. Insect Control: Some natural plant washes contain ingredients with natural insecticidal properties. These ingredients can help deter pests and reduce the likelihood of insect infestations on the plants. While they may not eliminate all pests, they can provide an additional layer of protection without the use of synthetic pesticides. Gentle and Non-Toxic: Natural plant washes are typically gentle on plants and do not cause harm or toxicity when used as directed. They are formulated to be safe for the plant's foliage and can be used throughout the flowering stage without adversely affecting the buds' development or taste. Environmental Sustainability: By choosing a natural plant wash, you contribute to a more sustainable approach to cultivation of the plant. These products are often biodegradable and have minimal impact on soil, water, and surrounding ecosystems. They offer an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides that can have negative environmental consequences. It's important to note that while natural plant washes can be beneficial for removing dust, debris, and pests, they are not a substitute for proper cultivation practices, including good hygiene, proper airflow, and pest prevention measures. This is a beneficial substance to plants. Non Food Production Use A product of any of the following types, intended only to aid the growth of desirable plants, is not a “plant regulator” under section 2(v) of FIFRA, and therefore is not a pesticide: A soil amendment product containing a substance or substances intended for the purpose of improving soil characteristics favorable for plant growth.",GREASE,,nutrients,"nutrients, nutrients, brand:GREASE",TRUE,Size,500 ml,,,,,3653,1739072,shopify,15,deny,manual,159.99,,TRUE,TRUE,0850018213134,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/green-sensation_567x567px-300x300-1200x1200.jpg,,GREEN wash Label 500ml,FALSE,GREEN wash Label 500ml,GREEN LABEL - CANNA PLANT WASH Canna Building Blocks The Green Label is a gem for the industrial production of the plant.

silicium-2,Silicium,"' SiLICIUM is beneficial for the regulation and the absorption of macro and micronutrients by the plant via xylem to the shoots and leaves. Silicon is translocated as anion, monosilicic acid, resulting as a silicon-cellulose membrane throughout the epidermal tissue. Found to have association with phosphorous and calcium ions, this process in which plant biomass enriches its level of silicon is called monosilicic acid polymerization. The application of SiLICIUM through the root system results in increased resistance and protection against diseases, drought, heat and other environmental stressors during vegetative and budding development. Using SiLicium, your plants will root faster and develop stronger stems, leaves and plant biomass overall. Silicon Rich structure increases the transport of calcium, phosphorus and other essential elements. Tighter node stacking results in more flowering sites. Accelerated growth rates occur from enhanced cellular structure within the plant. Dosage Use a minimum of 15mL per 100 Liters OR .5ML per 1 gal of feeding water throughout the growing cycle.

It strengthens stems, leaves, and overall biomass, while also increasing resistance to diseases, drought, heat, and environmental stresses during vegetative and budding stages. The application of SiLicium through the root system results in robust plant growth, with faster root development and stronger stems and leaves. This silicon-rich structure facilitates the transport of essential elements such as calcium and phosphorus, leading to tighter node stacking and increased flowering sites. Accelerated growth rates are achieved through enhanced cellular structures within the plant. For optimal results, it is recommended to use a dosage of at least 15mL per 100 Liters or 0.5mL per 1 gallon of feeding water throughout the entire growing cycle. It is crucial to mix SiLicium with tap or RO water before adding any other nutrients to ensure proper integration and effectiveness. DERIVED FROM Boric Acid Potassium Silicate Sodium Molybdenum Also Contains non-plant food ingredient 1.4% Silica (SiO2) from Potassium Silicate SiLicium offers multifaceted benefits for plant growth and development Facilitates the absorption and regulation of macro and micronutrients via xylem, enhancing overall plant health.

The integrated hemispherical reflectance is over 95% with an absence of iridescence colours in the louvre.</li> <li> <h2>Time for Improvement</h2> For Decades growers have settled for lighting options that are not 100% tailored for their use and crop. Grow light manufacturers are always trying to appease the mass populations of growers, rather than honing in on exactly what they need for optimal performance, yields, and most important quality. The engineering principles behind the DLI Open Reflector are a culmination of over a decade of research and development. The team works with a ranging group of some of the best horticulturists around the globe; each who specialise in plant and varietal specific production processes for the ornamental, and commercial flower market. Dutch Lighting Innovations has allowed these groups a new level of consistency, reliability, and quality unparalleled in the niche world of growing the best flowers and plants on Earth! <hr /> <h2>How it works</h2> The DLI reflectors are manufactured to have the highest possible total reflectance at all wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm giving excellent PAR rendition. The integrated hemispherical reflectance is over 95% with an absence of iridescence colours in the louvre. The DLI reflectors are made from an electrochemically brightened high purity aluminium substrate coil, and start with an anodised base coat which gives a hard support to minimize abrasion damage. The material is then treated under vacuum with specially developed processes to maximise coating adhesion and is vacuum coated with a super pure reflection layer of 99.99% pure aluminium. These reflection layers are overlaid with a dual layer oxide system tuned for maximum visible reflection enhancement. This serves to increase the overall reflectivity provided by the metallic layers and adds protection against damage.<img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-62528"" src=""https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DLI1000_l-200x79.jpg"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""79"" /><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-62529"" src=""https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/JOULE-SERIES-1000W-DE-dimmable-2-200x200.png"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""200"" /></li> </ul>",GH,,grow_lights,"grow_lights, brand:Unknown",TRUE,Size,1000W,,,,,SKID,843681,shopify,0,continue,manual,19000.00,21700.00,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/dlI-trio-images.jpg,1,“Dutch Lighting Innovations” JOULE-SERIES DE 120V – 240V/ Skid (62 Fixtures),FALSE,“Dutch Lighting Innovations” JOULE-SERIES DE 120V – 240V/ Skid (62 Fix,Dutch Lighting Innovations is an innovative company which develops and manufactures supplemental lighting systems for the global greenhouse industry.

alfa-grease-alfalfa-extract,Alfa Grease * Alfalfa Extract,"ALFALFA EXTRACT - YIELD Alfa Grease is a premium alfalfa extract that provides the natural hormone triacontanol. Triacontanol is a naturally occurring fatty alcohol derived from plant waxes, particularly found in high concentrations in the waxes of certain plant species, such as alfalfa, sugarcane, and rice bran. It is known for its potential beneficial effects on plant growth and development. Average yield increase of 20% consistently tested. Hormonal Regulation: Triacontanol can influence plant growth and development by modulating the levels and activities of plant hormones, such as auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, and abscisic acid. It can promote hormone synthesis, transport, and signal transduction pathways, which play crucial roles in regulating plant growth, flowering, fruiting, and other developmental processes. Photosynthetic Enhancement: One of the significant effects of triacontanol is its ability to enhance photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. Triacontanol has been reported to increase the efficiency of photosynthesis by promoting the activity of key enzymes involved in the process. This can lead to higher rates of carbon dioxide assimilation and energy production, ultimately contributing to better plant growth and development. Stress Tolerance: Triacontanol has been found to enhance the ability of plants to withstand various environmental stresses. It can help improve the plant's tolerance to abiotic stresses like drought, heat, cold, salinity, and heavy metal toxicity. Triacontanol activates stress-responsive genes and antioxidant systems in plants, providing protection against oxidative damage and maintaining cellular homeostasis under stressful conditions. Yield and Quality Improvement: Studies have shown that triacontanol application can result in increased crop yield and improved quality characteristics. It has been found to enhance fruit set, increase the number and size of flowers and fruits, improve seed germination and seedling vigor, and enhance nutrient uptake and utilization efficiency. These effects can lead to higher crop productivity and improved marketable traits of agricultural produce. Environmental Sustainability: Triacontanol is considered an environmentally friendly option for plant growth enhancement as it is a naturally occurring compound. It can be used as an alternative to synthetic growth regulators or chemical fertilizers, reducing reliance on synthetic inputs and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. This is a beneficial substance to plants. Hormone products consisting of a mixture of plant hormones, plant nutrients, inoculants, or soil amendments is not a “plant regulator” under section 2(v) of FIFRA, provided it meets the following criteria of low toxicity under 3 and 4 and product is not intended for use on food crop sites.

amber-label-sativa,Amber Label * Sativa,"AMBER LABEL - SATIVA Sativa Building Blocks GREASE, Amber Label is designed for all plants, but specifically sativa varieties. Like the original roots of our industry, the Amber Label is old as time. This new technology is a revolutionary approach to naturally enhancing your garden. Stress tolerant plants thrive drenched and sprayed with GREASE™ Amber Label, especially in hot times. Grease Amber Label bridges the gap and harnesses the building blocks of Sativa resins back on the Sativa plant itself. All Grease Label products work to increase resin, but when you align the source material with the target crop, the efficiency goes up resulting in the maximum yield of unique and targeted compounds. Physical Appearance: Sativa plants typically have a tall and slender stature with long, thin leaves. They grow taller than Indica plants, often reaching heights of several feet or even meters. Sativa strains are adapted to warmer climates and have a longer flowering time compared to Indicas. Effects: Sativa strains are commonly associated with uplifting and energizing effects. They are known to provide a ""head high"" that can be stimulating, creative, and cerebral. Sativa strains are often chosen for their potential therapeutic benefits in boosting mood, promoting focus, and increasing creativity. Cannabinoid Profile: Sativa strains tend to have higher levels of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and lower levels of CBD (cannabidiol) compared to Indicas. This cannabinoid profile contributes to their more psychoactive and uplifting effects. Aromas and Flavors: Sativa strains often exhibit a wide range of aromatic profiles, including fruity, citrusy, spicy, and floral aromas. The flavors of Sativa strains can also vary, with some being sweet, tangy, or herbal. Growing Characteristics: Sativa strains are typically more suited to outdoor cultivation due to their taller height and longer flowering period. They require ample space and a longer growing season to reach their full potential. Sativas have the potential to produce larger yields, but they require more care and attention during cultivation. This is a beneficial substance to plants.

aphrodite-s-extraction,Aphrodite's Extraction,"Aphrodite’s Extraction provides a rich blend of sucrose, fructose, chelated nutrients, vitamins, and organic acids to promote a thriving microbial population and strong, healthy plant growth. In addition to calcium, microbes need carbon in order to manufacture complex proteins for normal growth and reproduction: low carbon equals low microbial activity. Sucrose is one of the most available forms of carbon for a plant. When sucrose and fructose are blended with proteins, it becomes a microbial feast. Nutrients in Aphrodite’s Extraction are chelated to increase availability to the plant, promoting photosynthesis, structured soils, and increases in disease resistance and yields. This blend provides organic acids necessary for enzymatic activity, and a complete balance of vitamins A, C, D, E, B1, B6 and B12, which are essential to plants’ biological growth processes. Additionally, carbon in the soil determines the magnitude of the Earth’s magnetic field’s effect on plants. Greater carbon presence results in greater magnetic influence, which leads to a faster life cycle. TIP: Customers who use Aphrodite’s Extraction have experienced dramatic flavor improvements when applying it in the last weeks of the plants life cycle.

athena-cleanse,Athena Cleanse,"Athena Cleanse is made from the ideal (and safe) root zone optimizing agents--Hypochlorous acid. This safe and mild acid is derived from salt and a proprietary electrochemical treatment process. The result is a unique, plant-safe chemical with powerful oxidative properties to keep your root zone clean and free of unwanted organic and mineral buildup.<span style=""font-size: large;""> </span>These special properties reduce mineral scale in irrigation systems. <b> Key Features</b> <ul> <li>Non-toxic and non-nutritive - Safe to use on plants in and stage of growth</li> <li>Works to descale irrigation systems and decompose residual organic matter</li> <li>Effective as a final flush to remove mineral buildup (scale) in growing media and irrigation lines</li> <li>Very low TDS - Doesn't throw off mineral balance</li> <li>Effective as a final flush to clean growing media</li> <li>Keeps irrigation system cleaner and running efficiently longer</li> <li>Reduces mineral buildup in media and lines</li> </ul> How To Use <b>System Maintenance:</b> Irrigation systems that are regularly maintained with Athena Cleanse treatment will last longer, and run more optimally throughout. This is because Cleanse helps break down scale, mineral buildup, and other organic matter that has been lodged in the system. <b>Regular Use:</b> Use a dilute mixture of 2-5 mL per gallon water for regular maintenance. <b>Severe Conditions:</b> Increase rate to 5-10 mL per gallon water for combatting severe reservoir and growing media conditions. <b>Cuttings/Clones:</b> Athena Cleanse a must for all cloning machines and fresh cuttings. Dip fresh cuttings in a solution of Cleanse (10 mL per gallon) to improve cell health and increase immunity. Seedlings and cuttings treated with Cleanse have more vigor and are more likely to grow into robust plants. Roots of plants treated with Cleanse will be bright white and bursting with tiny feeder root hairs. These special properties reduce mineral scale in irrigation systems and the growing media. <b>RDWC and Other Recirculating Hydroponics Systems:</b> Any recirculating or deep water culture (DWC) irrigation system should use Athena Cleanse remove mineral residue and reduce scale. Irrigation water treated with Cleanse has a reduced risk of developing problems that are often associated with overwatering and insufficient oxygen levels, such as anaerobic microbial growth and biofilm buildup. Using Cleanse in a recirculating or DWC system helps break down materials with lower solubility ratings, such as mineral complexes that are no longer available to plants. Mineral buildup and lockout is a major cause of deficiencies and plant health problems-solve these issues with Athena Cleanse. <b>Media/System Flush Mix:</b> Athena Cleanse at a rate of 5-10 mL/ gallon of water during the final flush stage to help reduce residual mineral buildup in the growing media. This procedure may be used at any time during vegetative or flowering phases if the growing media or irrigation system develops mineral imbalance or unwanted buildup. <b>Foliar Applications:</b> Mix 375 mL Cleanse per gallon water and spray evenly. Test on a small area first to ensure no damage. <b>Surface Treatment/Cleaning:</b> Spraying cultivation surfaces, work areas and irrigation equipment with a dilute solution of Athena Cleanse (375 mL per gallon) helps maintain a clean and trouble-free environment without toxic and dangerous chemicals.

athena-s-aminas,Athena's Aminas,"<p>Every plant needs certain compounds for growth beyond soil, light, water, and CO2. Athena’s Aminas provides a readily available source of amino acids to optimize protein production and allow for maximum growth rates. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are the basic components of living cells. If not readily available, amino acids can be a limiting factor in growth rates. Plants use amino acids present in the soil, and synthesize them from elements sourced from soil, air, and water. However, plants can generally use more amino acids than they can find or synthesize in their natural environment. If amino acids are not abundant, plant growth slows necessarily to match availability of the most limiting factors. By adding an amino acid source, you enable your plants to build proteins as quickly as they are able. When using Athena’s Aminas, you can expect to see faster, healthier growth, resulting in bigger, more vigorous plants and a greater ability to resist pests and disease.</p> <p>Also known as Amino Blast by Harvest Moon Organics.</p>",Nickel City Wholesale Garden Supply,,nutrients,"nutrients, catalog_index; nutrients, brand:Athena",TRUE,Size,Quart,,,,,hmh01375,1361,shopify,11,deny,manual,14.66,,TRUE,TRUE,0812863010139,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Aphrodite1.jpg,,Athena's Aminas,FALSE,Athena's Aminas,"Every plant needs certain compounds for growth beyond soil, light, water, and CO2.

Bison Extract is naturally derived from bison compost to feed the enzyme factories in your roots and shoots. Enhanced chelation of minerals for rapid growth. Makes a really nice 'instant compost tea' that will make buds swell up.</p> <ol> <li style=""list-style-type: none;""> <ol> <li><strong>Nutrient-Rich Soil Amendment:</strong> Compost tea is derived from compost, which is a valuable source of organic matter and nutrients. When the compost is steeped in water and brewed into a liquid extract, the resulting tea becomes a nutrient-rich solution. When applied to the soil, it enriches the soil with essential nutrients, promoting healthy plant growth and development.</li> <li><strong>Microbial Boost:</strong> Compost tea is teeming with beneficial microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes. These microorganisms contribute to the overall microbial diversity and activity in the soil. When applied, they help improve soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and organic matter decomposition. The increased microbial activity can also suppress harmful pathogens and diseases in the soil.</li> <li><strong>Soil Structure and Water Retention:</strong> The organic matter present in compost tea improves soil structure by increasing soil aggregation and porosity. This enhances the soil's ability to retain water, reducing water runoff and increasing water availability to plant roots. Improved soil structure also promotes better root penetration and aeration, leading to healthier root development.</li> <li><strong>Enhanced Nutrient Uptake:</strong> The beneficial microorganisms in compost tea help break down organic matter and convert nutrients into plant-available forms. They form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, aiding in nutrient uptake and absorption. This can result in improved nutrient utilization by plants and increased nutrient efficiency.</li> <li><strong>Disease Suppression:</strong> Compost tea can help suppress soil-borne diseases and pathogens. The beneficial microorganisms in the tea compete with harmful organisms for resources and space, reducing the risk of plant infections. Compost tea's disease-suppressive properties can contribute to a healthier growing environment for plants.</li> <li><strong>Environmental Sustainability:</strong> Using compost tea from bison compost aligns with environmentally sustainable gardening practices. It allows for the recycling and reuse of organic waste materials, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers and chemical inputs. Compost tea promotes a more sustainable and natural approach to plant nutrition and soil health.</li> </ol> </li> </ol>",Bison Extract,,nutrients,"nutrients, brand:Bison Extract",TRUE,,,,,,,,3834,shopify,0,continue,manual,19.97,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BisonExtractcopy_3d4d82d6-de13-44d3-9648-f399fff099fa-1-scaled.webp,1,Bison Extract * Liquid Compost Tea,FALSE,Bison Extract * Liquid Compost Tea,LIQUID BISON BREW - TASTE PROFILE Bison compost extract for peak flavor.

Cost-effective and nutrient rich ferment, highly compatible with ALL fertilizers. If using as your base nutrient, DOUBLE the drench recommended rate on the bottle or feed chart. Nutrient Boost: Canna flowers are rich in essential nutrients, including cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids. Fermenting canna flowers can help break down these compounds and release them in a bioavailable form. The resulting fermented plant juice can provide a nutrient boost to the canna plants, promoting healthy growth and enhancing the production of cannabinoids and other beneficial compounds. Organic Fertilizer: Fermented plant juice from canna flowers can serve as a natural and organic fertilizer. It contains a variety of organic compounds that can contribute to the overall nutrient profile of the plants. By utilizing fermented plant juice during the flowering stage, you can supply additional nutrients to support the development of robust buds and enhance the quality of the final harvest. Enhanced Terpene Profile: Terpenes are aromatic compounds found in canna flowers that contribute to the unique flavors and aromas of different strains. Fermenting canna flowers can potentially enhance the terpene profile by breaking down complex compounds and releasing aromatic substances. This can lead to more pronounced and desirable flavors and aromas in the final canna product. Microbial Activity: Fermentation involves the activity of beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. These microorganisms can help break down organic matter, improve soil structure, and enhance nutrient availability. Applying fermented plant juice from canna flowers to the soil can introduce these beneficial microorganisms, fostering a healthy soil microbiome and promoting optimal nutrient uptake by the plants. Sustainable Approach: Utilizing fermented plant juice from canna flowers supports a sustainable approach to cultivation.

blue-grease-algae-extract,Blue Grease * Algae Extract,"Algae Extract - Antioxidant Targeted naturally occurring antioxidant for plants. Blue Grease contains the highest quality phycocyanin naturally derived from blue-green algae One of the only naturally occurring blue pigments on Earth, derived from blue-green algae. Blue Grease is a premium extract known as phycocyanin, which works as an antioxidant within the plant, and is a critical accessory pigment for chlorophyll which runs photosynthesis in the plant. Light-Harvesting Apparatus: In photosynthetic organisms like blue-green algae, phycocyanin serves as a light-harvesting apparatus. It captures light energy and transfers it to chlorophyll, which is involved in the process of photosynthesis. By absorbing light in the blue and red regions of the spectrum, phycocyanin maximizes the energy available for photosynthesis, promoting the growth and survival of these organisms. Rich in nutrients: Algae is a natural source of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and trace elements like zinc, iron, and copper. These nutrients are vital for plant growth and play a crucial role in supporting various physiological processes. Growth-promoting hormones: Algae contains natural growth hormones like auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, which stimulate cell division, root development, and overall plant growth. These hormones help plants adapt to stress, enhance root systems, and encourage healthy foliage growth. Enhanced root development: The growth hormones present in algae contribute to robust root development. Strong and healthy root systems improve nutrient and water uptake, making plants more resilient to environmental stressors. Improved stress tolerance: The organic compounds and minerals in algae help plants build resistance against environmental stress, such as drought, heat, and cold. It aids in improving plant health and vitality, even under challenging conditions. Increased plant metabolism: Algae extracts encourage enhanced metabolic activities within plants, leading to improved photosynthesis and nutrient assimilation. This can result in healthier and more vigorous plant growth. Disease and pest resistance: The nutrients and bioactive compounds in algae help bolster a plant's natural defense mechanisms, making them more resistant to diseases and pests. Better nutrient uptake: Algae contains natural chelating agents that facilitate the uptake of essential nutrients from the soil, making them more available to the plants. This improves overall nutrient utilization efficiency. Improved soil structure: When used as a soil amendment, algae can enhance soil structure by promoting the growth of beneficial soil microorganisms. It increases soil porosity, aeration, and water retention, creating an optimal environment for plant roots. Organic and eco-friendly: Algae-based fertilizers are considered environmentally friendly since they are derived from natural sources and do not harm the soil or surrounding ecosystems. Stimulated flowering and fruiting: The plant growth hormones in algae can help stimulate flowering and fruiting processes, resulting in increased flower and fruit production in many plant species. Balanced pH levels: The organic matter in algae can help buffer soil pH levels, creating a more balanced and favorable environment for plant growth. Sustainable agriculture: Utilizing algae-based fertilizers promotes sustainable farming practices by reducing the dependency on synthetic fertilizers and their potential environmental impact. With photosynthesis being the main driver of ALL plant processes, it is very important to keep photosynthesis support. This consistency of energy supporting your plant leads to the maximization of all the vital systems including overall yield, resin production, terpenes, plant defense, and nutritional benefits. Most importantly it does this quickly, and with a short term plant with a narrow window of growth this is critical. Our studies show accelerated growth and enhanced energy uptake by the plant when using Blue Grease. Some plants may even take on a darker green pigmentation in veg and more easily produce purples and blues in flower. Reactive oxygen and other compounds may cause continuous stress within the plant. All of the main abiotic and biotic stress factors such as heat, cold, damage, and UV ends up being oxidative stress due to the plants ability to cope with these factors. The natural antioxidants in Blue Grease offset this, and help the plant deal with all forms of damage. Blue Grease relieves genetic stress on the DNA level, allowing the plant to focus energy on faster growth and cell replication. Less glitches in the code that runs your plants. A smoother zipping and unzipping of these genes allows the full expression of the plant to be realized. Blue Grease makes a more efficient and happier plant that will yield dividends for you when it comes time to harvest and extract. Rest assured all of our products are guaranteed tested to be free of any pesticides, heavy metals, or residual solvents. Guaranteed to test clean in any laboratory analysis.

Many calcium-intensive plants, like lettuce and tomatoes, need that extra Ca+ boost to optimize growth. This prevents diseases related to calcium deficiency like blossom-end rot (a disease that causes the bottom of fruits to rot on the vine). CALiMAGic™ also prevents leaf tip burn: drying and curling leaves due to a shortage of calcium in leaf tissue. Calcium deficiency affects a huge range of plants but can easily be remedied with a little CALiMAGic™!

This machines sits at a trim 24’’ in length X 10’’ width and 21’’ in height. Weighing only 35 lbs, this trimmer is the epitome of elegant engineering at its finest. Built for the connoisseur who admires the finer things in life, this machine was designed to be the most delicate machine on the market today. Don’t be fooled by the size, the Tabletop Pro replaces over 6 human trimmers without sacrific-ing quality. This trimmer is currently being shipped World Wide to small growers who demand quality, durability, and privacy. This machine works with dry flowers and will harvest 3-4 lbs dry per hour of use. The Tabletop Pro runs completely off 120v power and comes with a strong 1hp leaf collector with 1800 CFM of suction power. Another quality of the Tabletop Pro is ease of keeping the blade clean, which is made out of D2 hardened steel. Unlike any other brand on the market, The Centurion Tabletop Pro employs a magnetic blade holding technology that allows for a five minute clean-up during operation, ensur-ing the machine has a consistently sharp, clean cut, and operates at a rapid pace. The Centurion brand is the only machines in the world that come inclusive with a non-stick QuanTanium Coated tumbler. The non-stick properties of the QuanTanium tumbler prevent precious trichomes from adhering to the tumbler surface. This results in the flowers having a better visual appearance while maintaining their strong natural aroma and flavours. Overall, you will notice a more potent flower as all natural properties are preserved during the harvesting process. The extra large hopper makes consistent feeding of the machine easier. Centurion machines are the only brand that uses a unique diverter to help fine tune the flow and cut on different strains giving the grower the ability to quickly adjust to different strains, or density of flowers. These diverters are how the machine can process dry flowers so delicately while still ensuring a tight clean cut and finish!

Endomycorrhizae have been shown to benefit over 90% of all plants. <p>The Clonex brand; including Clonex Gel, Clonex Clone Solution and Clonex Mist, has been the world leader in plant propagation for nearly 30 years with billions of clones successfully rooted. <p>Clonex Root Maximizer is the newest addition to the Clonex family and is the result of over a decade of dedicated research into mycorrhiza, the specialized beneficial root fungus that assists in the absorption of minerals and water from the soil. <p>Mycorrhizae actually increase the surface area of plant roots, which allows the plant to reach nutrients and water that might not be available otherwise. Put simply, mycorrhizae extends the plant’s reach, allowing it to get to more of what it needs to survive. The fungus is actually a network of filaments that grow in and around the plant root cells, forming a mass that extends considerably beyond the plant’s root system. This makes the plant stronger and more resistant to stress. Mycorrhizae even protect their host plant against unwanted pathogens. Clonex Root Maximizer puts life into your soil by adding bountiful amounts of mycorrhizae fungi, beneficial bacteria and Trichoderma that combine to improve the health and vitality of plants. <li>Treating your young plants with Clonex Root Maximizer will give them the head start needed to reach their genetic potential leading to better quality and higher yields. <p>Directions for Use <li>For Transplants: Apply product directly in contact with plant roots. For larger plants (3 gallon pots and larger) apply 2 tablespoons (30ml) per plant. For smaller plants (less than 3 gallon pots), apply 1 teaspoon (5ml) per plant. <li>For Planting Seeds: Apply product in the furrow beneath the seed at the rate of 1 tablespoon (15ml) per row foot, or broadcast at the rate of 2 tablespoons (30ml) per square foot and rake into the upper soil layer before planting. <p>Storage <p>Store in a cool dry place with prolonged temperatures not exceeding 90 F (32.2 C). <li>Avoid direct sunlight. <li>Product should be used in a well-ventilated place. <p>GRANULAR/Soil-Soiless <li>Glomus intraradices.........104 propagules/gm <li>Glomus deserticola...........9 propagules/gm <li>Glomus etunicatum...........9 propagules/gm <li>Glomus clarum................. 9 propagules/gm <li>Glomus claroideum...........9 propagules/gm <li>Gigaspora albida...............9 propagules/gm <li>Trichoderma harzianum....145,000 CFU/gm <li>Bacillus brevis...................98,000 CFU/gm <li>Bacillus subtilis.................115,000 CFU/gm",Clonex Root,,propagation,"propagation, brand:Clonex Root",TRUE,,,,,,,hmh01748,0,shopify,0,continue,manual,85.00,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RootMaxGroupGranular-scaled.jpg,1,Clonex Root Maximizer - Granular/ for soil applications,FALSE,Clonex Root Maximizer - Granular/ for soil applications,Clonex Root Maximizer - Granular/ for soil applications This product is designed to be used in a soil system as a dry application.

dli-diode-series-led-toplighting-led-fixture-long,DLI-DIODE-Series-LED Toplighting LED Fixture (Long),"DLI Toplighting fixtures are designed to deliver high levels of photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) values with optimal angled vertical light uniformity. The unique design of the lens creates a high uniform light distribution over the canopy. The fixtures are constructed in a slim water-proof design and suspended above the plant canopy with the easy-hang system. Toplighting fixture (long) Features Extra Low-Profile Housing (Ideal for low ceilings) Venturi effect (For optimal cooling) High Output (Up to 1000 µmol/s) IP65 Waterproof (Protected against water jets from any direction) Time for Improvement For Decades growers have settled for lighting options that are not 100% tailored for their use and crop. Grow light manufacturers are always trying to appease the mass populations of growers, rather than honing in on exactly what they need for optimal performance, yields, and most important quality. The engineering principles behind the DLI Toplighting Fixtures are a culmination of over a decade of research and development. The team works with a ranging group of some of the best horticulturists around the globe; each who specialise in plant and varietal specific production processes for the ornamental, and commercial flower market. Dutch Lighting Innovations has allowed these groups a new level of consistency, reliability, and quality unparalleled in the niche world of growing the best flowers and plants on Earth! For a uniform plant a uniform pattern is required A percentage of harvestable plant height can suffer from lack of light due to dense canopy foliage; which will result in fewer flowers. Because of the unique light distribution the Toplighting system will provide High PAR PPF at an optimized coverage angle making sure the whole plant is activated by light. Extensive trials have shown bigger leaves and flowers at the lower portions on the plant. The Toplighting fixtures emit very little heat and require no active cooling minimizing leaf burn.

etoh-pro-rev2-ethanol-botanical-extractor-odorless-closed-loop-high-volume,EtOH Pro REV2 Ethanol Botanical Extractor - Odorless Closed-Loop High Volume,"“EtOH” is the scientific abbreviation for ethanol. It seemed perfect to use in the name of the second iteration of extraction equipment from ExtractCraft following the great success of the Source Turbo. The EtOH PRO was born. Even though The EtOH PRO is younger, it’s essentially the Source Turbo’s big brother. They both do the same thing in performing ethanol extraction easily and safely, from botanical material like lavender, sandalwood, hops, and mushrooms to anything you’d like to use in culinary arts, scenting, smoking, vaping, and medicine making. Like the Source Turbo, the EtOH PRO produces incredible, high-quality concentrates but quickly does it in a much larger volume. The EtOH PRO is an advanced extraction equipment with capabilities normally found only in a lab. It is designed to be the workhorse on a benchtop for small businesses or advanced hobbyists. The unit has a 4-liter liquid volume capacity, which equates to processing about a pound or more of dry botanical material. We’ve developed some incredible science applications, including a utility patent and process patent for heat flux management that controls vacuum and heat via one control contained in this beauty. Internal vacuum generation and heat delivery tuned specifically for low-temperature ethanol evaporation push vapor from the loading kettle through an air-driven condenser and into a collection vessel where the reclaimed ethanol is collected. All that science, work, and control is accomplished by a technologically advanced system that requires only a single push of a green button. <strong>HOW THE PROCESS OPERATES</strong> The EtOH PRO performs the important operation of evaporating and purging ethanol in the ethanol extraction process. Traditionally, evaporation for at-home extraction has been accomplished by allowing ethanol to evaporate slowly for a couple of days or boiling it in an open atmosphere with high heat. Neither of those options is good because natural evaporation takes far too long, and boiling off ethanol with high heat destroys the most flavorful and aromatic elements of an extraction, thus destroying quality. Most concerning, both options fill the surrounding air with combustible fumes, which is wasteful and dangerous. The EtOH PRO is designed to address and eliminate those problems. The EtOH PRO is a fully contained closed-loop system that solves old ethanol evaporation problems without cumbersome, difficult-to-use, expensive lab equipment. Vacuum technology and advanced systems control the evaporation of ethanol away from the soon-to-be concentrate at around 100°F and safely collect it for reuse. The very low operational temperatures preserve the most delicate attributes of an extraction, creating the most high-quality, potent oil possible. Reclaiming ethanol for reuse keeps the dangerous fumes from filling the surroundings, saves significant money with every use, eliminates waste, and contributes greatly to sustainability. When the extraction process is completed, the pure oil concentrate remains in the Kettle, and the clean reclaimed ethanol is separated in the collector. <strong>WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EtOH PRO AND OTHER DEVICES?</strong> <strong>Extraction vs Infusion</strong> A common question is, “What’s the difference between the EtOH PRO and other butter makers and infusion devices?” The difference is enormous; to understand this, we must differentiate between “infusion” and “extraction.” “Infusion” is the act of soaking botanical matter in a large amount of butter or carrier oil (like olive oil) to absorb the botanical oil contained in the plant. Regardless of claims to the contrary, the butter makers and infusion machines only perform the simple act of infusion, resulting in a large volume of the fat-based carrier with a comparably low potency end product. The exact process can be safely and easily accomplished on the stovetop, in a slow cooker, or any combination of a vessel and heat source. Infusion devices don’t concentrate oil or butter in any way. Instead, they merely steep the plant material like a slow cooker, allowing the added butter or oil to absorb the oils from it, leaving the user with no control over potency. “Extraction” is entirely different, harvesting only pure oil from botanicals without added carrier oil, butter, or fat. The user extracts only pure botanical oils. Highly potent, pure concentrates result only from extraction, and the EtOH PRO is a great tool for doing that. Pure oil from extraction is the base for any form of concentrate: tincture, concentrated tincture, absolute oil, wax, budder, pull-n-snap, shatter, edibles, topicals, and more. Moreover, using concentrates for cooking provides a substantially cleaner and delicious end product and the ultimate control of potency. A larger amount of concentrate can be combined with a small amount of butter to make it ungodly potent, or less can be added to a larger amount of butter to ease the strength as much as desired. The EtOH PRO delivers great versatility to safely make high-quality concentrates from any botanical, in any form or potency, creating a level of freedom and agility infusion devices can only dream of. <strong>Ethanol Extraction Systems: Open vs. Closed Loop vs. Vacuum Assisted Closed Loop</strong> How ethanol is boiled, evaporated, and, in some cases, recaptured for re-use is determined by the type of system being used. An <strong>“open”</strong> system boils ethanol by applying heat and evaporating the vapor into the open air. Examples of this are old-school methods like using a pot on a hot plate or a rice cooker. Open evaporation causes many obvious safety, quality, and affordability problems. When performing extractions, safety is paramount, and evaporating ethanol into the air of an enclosed area is very dangerous since those fumes are combustible and will easily ignite. Quality is another problem resulting from the high temperature required to boil ethanol under normal ambient pressure. In an open system, ethanol boils at about 173°F, which is too high. It destroys the delicate and beautiful compounds that define a quality concentrate and chemically alters its makeup, limiting post-processing options. Hot plates, pots, and rice cookers are inexpensive, so many people mistakenly consider this the cheapest processing option; however, when all aspects of extraction are considered, there’s an affordability paradox that makes this process one of the most costly. The rice cooker may be inexpensive, but ethanol isn’t cheap, and letting it evaporate into the air is an enormous waste of money that adds up quickly. Next, the final product's quality, and hence the value, must be accounted for, and the high-temperature purge used in open systems will produce the lowest quality medication. Low-quality, less potent meds won’t go far, don’t last as long, and require you to use more overall, seriously decreasing value. Additionally, openly boiling ethanol requires constant attention and supervision, wasting valuable time you could spend doing something else important or relaxing. The low cost may make the rice cooker and other open system methods attractive to a home user, but they’re unsafe, produce low-quality concentrates, and are not the most affordable option. <strong>“Closed loop”</strong> systems also evaporate ethanol at open atmosphere temperatures of around 173°F, just like a rice cooker, but have the added ability to capture and reclaim some of the evaporated ethanol for reuse. The most popular of these devices are simple water distillers. They aren’t really closed loop because they vent into the open, but they are similar. These devices partially solve two of the problems associated with completely open systems to a limited degree. Safety is better because a good amount of the alcohol vapor is captured, condensed, and collected for reuse. However, most of these devices drain into an open recovery vessel from condensers that get overwhelmed by the volume of hot vapor pushed through them, allowing a lot of vapor to escape into the open air. This is a little safer but far from perfect. In my experience, the average ethanol reclaim with these is around 60%-70%. A water distiller can be more expensive than a rice cooker, but it’s a little safer and more affordable in the long term because the ethanol is recaptured for reuse. Now for the bad news. These machines are designed for water distillation, not oil extraction, creating serious quality and operational problems. Extractions made using a distiller or a rice cooker suffer from the same quality limitations. Distillers also work under normal ambient pressure, so the operating temperatures are high, and the extract quality is low. It can also be frustrating because you can’t see inside during the process, and the oil must be removed from a fixed vat. Using one is cumbersome, difficult to empty, dangerously hot, and wasteful. For an average at-home user, these units are quite large, with substantial surface area in the oil collection area, and are made to run large amounts of water, so if you need to run a small batch, you’ll have difficulties. Distillers are an acceptable choice if you’re only making large batches of oil and willing to sacrifice safety and quality for the production volume, but that’s all they’re capable of. <div></div> The most advanced systems are <strong>“Vacuum Assisted Closed Systems,”</strong> and this is where the EtOH PRO shines. Adding a vacuum to a closed system keeps all of the vapor activity enclosed within a self-contained unit, allowing virtually nothing to escape, and the low internal pressure allows the EtOH PRO to boil and evaporate ethanol at around 100°F. The ability to operate at low temperatures in an enclosed environment solves all the problems the other devices suffer from. It’s safe because everything is reclaimed internally, allowing no dangerous fumes or odors to escape during operation. In addition to vastly improved safety, the quality of the extractions and concentrates is unmatched. Using such low temperatures for the entire process ensures that all the good stuff extracted from the plant is saved, protected, and packed into the concentrate. The quality is so tasty, smooth, and potent that it’s unbelievable, and this high quality is key to great value. Higher quality, more potent medication will go further, last longer, and require you to use less overall, seriously increasing value and savings. Contrary to many people’s first impression, the EtOH PRO is the most affordable option for at-home extraction, even with the higher initial cost. What must be understood about the EtOH PRO is that affordability and value are more than just a price tag. The EtOH PRO provides great money savings in ethanol with every use, safe and easy operation, wildly superior quality concentrates, a processing time of around 2 hours, and loads of fun experimenting with unlimited crafting possibilities. &nbsp;",GH,,extraction,"extraction, brand:GH",TRUE,,,,,,,,13608,shopify,0,continue,manual,1900.00,2100.00,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Plantmax-High-Pressure-Sodium-e1576439331190-200x200.jpg.webp,,EtOH Pro REV2 Ethanol Botanical Extractor - Odorless Closed-Loop High Volume,FALSE,EtOH Pro REV2 Ethanol Botanical Extractor - Odorless Closed-Loop High,“EtOH” is the scientific abbreviation for ethanol.

floraduo-complete,FloraDuo Complete,"<b>FloraDuo Complete, concentrated and cost effective.<br> FloraDuo is a new formula derived from the latest scientific discoveries</b> <br><br> FloraDuo is a ""classic"" mineral nutrient, with a difference (and an essential one), where each of the elements a plant needs is derived from a large variety of different sources. To create an excellent nutrient, you need of course a precise formula. But this is not all! It also is very important that each element comes from different sources, and different salts. This is how they are made available at all times, in a form plants can absorb them. And we don't stop at that. We add in our bottle elements we could call ""bio-activators"", that are not directly nutrients for plants, but which improve their general health, help them better absorb their food, and better resist to pathogen and insect aggressions. <br><br> FloraDuo is a complete nutrient, especially designed for fast growing plants, with a marked difference between growth and flowering needs. It comes in 2 parts: FloraDuo Grow and FloraDuo Bloom. it to all regions, FloraDuo is highly concentrated : 4 ml/L are enough for a balanced and vigorous growth. Its price also is very attractive. <br><br> FloraDuo is economical and cost effective. FloraDuo is also user-friendly : by mixing 3 parts FloraDuo Grow with 1 part FloraDuo Bloom, you'll address all growth requirements. Then, by reversing these proportions (3 parts Bloom with 1 part Grow), you'll attend to all fl owering needs. FloraDuo guarantees a perfect balance between growing and flowering. You need nothing else for abundant and healthy yields. Like for all our nutrients, FloraDuo is an exhaustive formula: no need for complements to improve your plants diet. It includes 30 years of studies and experience, from our years collaborating with research laboratories (particularly with the University of California at Davis), and also thanks to the information provided by thousands of people using our products worldwide.",,,nutrients,"catalog_index; nutrients, brand:General Hydroponics",TRUE,,,,,,,hmh00026,0,shopify,0,continue,manual,170.00,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0672/5730/3114/files/7a6a0bb4__flora-duo.jpg?v=1766351644,1,FloraDuo Complete,FALSE,FloraDuo Complete,"FloraDuo Complete, concentrated and cost effective.

floranectar,FloraNectar,"<i>Sweetener</i> Our scientists have formulated FloraNectar to optimize the greatest transference of sweetness and aroma into your fruits and flowers. FloraNectar contains all natural raw cane sugar, molasses, malt syrup, select plant based esters, L-amino acids, organic acids, polyflavonoids, vitamins and essential minerals. This unique blend of ingredients helps your plants regulate enzymes that trigger specific reactions involved in maintaining optimal metabolism. This allows your plants to achieve a balance between respiration and photosynthesis in high intensity growing environments where the rate of respiration can sometimes exceed the rate of photosynthesis. As a result, FloraNectar ensures optimal metabolic rates during the flowering and fruiting phase when nitrogen levels have been reduced. FloraNectar also promotes a sturdier plant structure during the vegetative phase when high levels of nitrogen are present.

It is a very smelly, very tasty kush, with a very stoned effect. The Flowerbomb Kush grows stretchier than most kushes, with long branches that compete with the main cola. The leaves are thick, overlapping, and very dark green, with black hues. The plants can be fed medium EC levels, and perform well in hydroponics, but in soil, the flavour and taste are even sweeter and fruitier. The buds are irregular in shape, with extra-large calyxes forming tower,s and are prone to foxtail. The buds get very compact and extremely dense. The resin is extremely thick and extends to most of the leaves once the flowering is reaching the end. The Flowerbomb Kush is not the heaviest producer, but it gives a unique quality. The first flavour is earthy, mossy, very much like an OG kush, but immediately after the explosion of fruits invades the palate. And it ends with a spicier side, almost edgy.

The people that knew Franco know that his favorite strain of all time was the Cheese, and particularly the Exodus Cheese. This cross is very special to the Green House Seeds family, because this cut of Exodus Cheese was selected with Dust when Franco was still living in Barcelona around 2015 and it has a special meaning to us. To pair this incredible strain that is the Exodus Cheese, which is so complex in taste already, we wanted to add something vigorous. We believe the best match for this, with gassy notes, (which is what we thought the exodus lacked), is one of our latest selections from Sunset Sherbert x Diagonal OG by Cannarado Genetics. The phenotype selected had that perfect bud shape and smell from the Diagonal OG but with the creaminess and sweetness of the Sunset, a perfect mix of both with a beautiful plant structure typical to the OG. The result came out as a stunning cross that combines the powerful and pungent smell of the Exodus Cheese with the plant structure and vigor of the Sherbert OG.",,,seeds,"catalog_index; seeds, brand:H Moon Hydro",TRUE,,,,,,,,113,shopify,0,continue,manual,66.00,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GHSC_Fullgas__WEB.jpg-153x200.jpg.webp,,Fullgas!

gaia-mania,Gaia Mania,"<p>Gaia Mania is one of Oregon’s Only Organics’ original products, and was designed to work as a standalone nutrient for home gardeners. This product has been around for many years, under many labels, and has now found its home as Gaia Mania. Gaia Mania is a careful blend of organic materials, enzymatically processed to extract only proteins and humates. This digestion process is the beginning step in the absorption of vitamins, acids and minerals by the plant. Gaia Mania has the ability to feed plants immediately, and is also designed to promote microbial populations in your medium, offering greater protection to plants’ root systems. All of the nitrogen in this product is protein based. This is the healthiest form of nitrogen for plants, promoting strong, healthy growth without a tendency toward elongation as with sodium based nitrates. Plants grow healthiest when they are grown with proteins, organic acids, and calcium based products. Addition of calcium will improve the uptake of Gaia Mania.</p> <p>Also known as Bioactive Organic Supplement by Harvest Moon Organics.</p>",Nickel City Wholesale Garden Supply,,nutrients,"nutrients, catalog_index; nutrients, brand:Nectar",TRUE,Size,Quart,,,,,hmh01390,2268,shopify,25,deny,manual,17.45,,TRUE,TRUE,0812863010092,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gaia.jpg,1,Gaia Mania,FALSE,Gaia Mania,"Gaia Mania is one of Oregon’s Only Organics’ original products, and was designed to work as a standalone nutrient for home gardeners.

gold-label-hybrid,GOLD LABEL * HYBRID,"GOLD LABEL * HYBRID Hybrid Building Blocks The Gold Label is the foundation of the GREASE™ line designed specifically to increase potency and terpenes. Hybrid plants respond to the Gold, elevating stickiness and aromas and presenting their uniqueness. It acts as a soil conditioner and is bioavailable through the roots or via spray. You need to see it and spray it to believe it! ""This stuff works"" is the sentiment shared by all users. Grease Gold Label bridges the gap and harnesses the building blocks of Hybrids resins back on the Hybrid plant itself. All Grease Label products work to increase resin, but when you align the source material with the target crop, the efficiency goes up resulting in the maximum yield of unique and targeted compounds. Hybrid varieties are created through the intentional breeding of different canna strains, resulting in offspring that possess a combination of the traits from their parent plants. The goal of hybridization is to produce offspring with desirable characteristics such as specific flavors, aromas, canna profiles, growth patterns, and effects. There are two main types of hybrids: F1 hybrids and polyhybrids. F1 Hybrids: F1 hybrids, also known as first-generation hybrids, are created by crossing two different strains with distinct characteristics. The resulting offspring exhibit a combination of traits from both parent strains. F1 hybrids are often highly sought after due to their genetic stability and uniformity, as the offspring from the cross tend to display consistent traits. Polyhybrids: Polyhybrids refer to plants that are the result of multiple generations of hybridization. In polyhybrids, breeders select and cross multiple strains, creating complex genetic lineages with diverse characteristics. Polyhybrids offer a wider range of traits, including variations in flavor, aroma, potency, and growth patterns. These variations can result in a more diverse and unique experience. Polyhybrids are favored by breeders and growers who seek to develop new and distinct cultivars. By carefully selecting and crossing multiple strains, breeders can create offspring that exhibit a wide array of desirable traits, catering to different preferences and market demands. This is a beneficial substance to plants.

golden-gun-nano-sulfur,Golden Gun * Nano Sulfur,"<h2><strong>NANO SULFUR - TERPENE BOOSTER</strong></h2> <p style=""font-weight: 400;"">Harness the elemental power of sulfur to increase terpenes. Grease Golden Gun uses the power of sulfur to amp up terpene levels. Drench consistently for flavor. Knock the rust off with the golden bullet. Sulfur is an essential plant nutrient that plays a vital role in various biochemical processes within plants. It is involved in the synthesis of proteins, enzymes, vitamins, and other important compounds. When it comes to terpene production, sulfur availability can have a significant impact.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Precursor for Terpene Synthesis:</strong> Terpenes are a diverse group of compounds responsible for the characteristic aromas and flavors of plants. They are derived from isoprene units, which are built from the basic precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Sulfur is required for the synthesis of IPP and its conversion into other terpene compounds. Adequate sulfur availability ensures a sufficient supply of IPP, which can lead to increased terpene production.</li> <li><strong>Activation of Enzymes:</strong> Sulfur is involved in the activation of enzymes responsible for terpene biosynthesis. It helps in the formation and activity of key enzymes, such as terpene synthases, which catalyze the conversion of IPP into specific terpene compounds. Sulfur acts as a cofactor for these enzymes, enabling them to function optimally and enhance terpene production.</li> <li><strong>Regulation of Gene Expression:</strong> Sulfur can influence the expression of genes involved in terpene biosynthesis. It acts as a signaling molecule, triggering the upregulation of genes responsible for terpene production. Sulfur deficiency can lead to downregulation of these genes, resulting in reduced terpene synthesis. By ensuring an adequate supply of sulfur, the expression of terpene-related genes can be enhanced, leading to increased terpene levels.</li> <li><strong>Enhanced Secondary Metabolism:</strong> Sulfur availability influences the overall metabolism of plants, including secondary metabolites like terpenes. Adequate sulfur levels promote an optimal balance of primary and secondary metabolism, ensuring that resources are allocated towards terpene synthesis. Sulfur deficiency can disrupt this balance and redirect resources towards other metabolic pathways, potentially leading to decreased terpene production.</li> <li><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong> Terpenes play a crucial role in plant defense against herbivores, pathogens, and environmental stresses. They can act as natural repellents, toxins, or antimicrobial agents. Sulfur availability can influence the production of terpenes involved in plant defense mechanisms, enabling plants to respond more effectively to stressors and threats. By providing sufficient sulfur, plants can enhance their ability to produce terpenes with defensive properties.</li> <li><strong>Plant Nutrition:</strong> Sulfur is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development. It plays a vital role in the synthesis of proteins, enzymes, and chlorophyll, contributing to overall plant vigor and vitality. Sulfur provides a supplementary source of sulfur to plants, ensuring they have an adequate supply of this essential nutrient. Sulfur deficiency can lead to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced crop yields.</li> <li><strong>pH Adjustment:</strong> Sulfur can help regulate soil pH levels. It is commonly used to lower soil pH in alkaline soils, making them more acidic and creating a favorable environment for plants that prefer slightly acidic conditions. By adjusting the soil pH, Sulfur can improve nutrient availability and uptake by plants, enhancing their overall health and growth.</li> <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly:</strong> It is a naturally occurring substance and does not persist in the environment or pose significant risks to humans, animals, or beneficial insects when used correctly. It offers an alternative to synthetic pesticides and chemical treatments, promoting sustainable and organic farming practices.</li> </ol> <ul> <li>It's important to note that while sulfur is essential for terpene production, other factors such as genetics, environmental conditions, and overall plant health also play a role in terpene levels. Additionally, the specific effects of sulfur on terpene production may vary depending on the plant species and the specific terpene compounds involved. Optimal sulfur fertilization practices should be determined based on plant requirements, soil conditions, and local recommendations.</li> </ul>",GEASE,,nutrients,"nutrients, nutrients, brand:GEASE",TRUE,Size,1000 ml,,,,,3601,1739072,shopify,12,deny,manual,98.00,,TRUE,TRUE,0850018214018,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nano-960_preview.jpeg-324x324.jpg,,Golden Gun * Nano Sulfur,FALSE,Golden Gun * Nano Sulfur,NANO SULFUR - TERPENE BOOSTER Harness the elemental power of sulfur to increase terpenes.

You should check your pH meter frequently because the properties of the meters membrane is constantly changing from normal use and aging. We recommend a two point calibration between 4.0 and 7.0 to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 4.0 and 7.0. Ask your dealer for PHB-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes. <p> <b>PH Electrode Storage Solutions</b> <p> Use to store your pH meter electrode between use. This solution is designed to keep your electrode sensing membrane and reference junction clean and unclogged and ready for use. Store you electrode directly in a small cup of solution or saturate a sponge in the cap of your meter for storage between use. This will prevent your permeable glass membrane from becoming dry and from mineral deposits clogging the surface. This solution is designed to equalize the osmotic pressure of the reference solution in your meter junction to keep the reference solution from seeping out and prematurely aging your meter. Should your electrode membrane dry out soak it in this solution for at least two hours before use. NEVER STORE AN ELECTRODE IN DISTILLED OR DEIONIZED WATER.

green-label-wash,Green Label * WASH,"GREEN LABEL - CANNA PLANT WASH Canna Building Blocks The Green Label is a gem for the industrial production of the plant. It is harnessing the principles of biomimicry at its finest. Spray GREASE™ Green Label in veg and especially in flower. It is amazing to have a safe alternative to spray in flower that will not leave foreign oils or residues of any kind. All GREASE™ products are free from pesticide residuals, heavy metals or residual solvents. We recommend drenching as well, as it is a proven soil conditioner. Grease, Green Label bridges the gap and harnesses the building blocks of Canna resins back on the Canna plant itself. All Grease Label products work to increase resin, but when you align the source material with the target crop, the efficiency goes up resulting in the maximum yield of unique and targeted compounds. A natural plant wash, also known as a plant-based wash or organic wash, is an alternative to traditional chemical pesticides and can be used to remove dust and debris from the plants prior to harvesting. This is a first of its kind, new to the industry technology. Here are some benefits of using a natural Canna plant wash: Pesticide-Free: Natural plant washes are made from botanical extracts and essential oils derived from plants. They do not contain synthetic chemicals or harmful pesticides, making them a safer and more environmentally friendly option for cultivation of the plant. Residue Removal: Plants can accumulate dust, dirt, and other debris on their leaves and buds during the growing process. A natural plant wash helps remove these residues effectively, leaving the plants clean and free from contaminants. This can improve the appearance, quality, and overall cleanliness of the harvested buds. Insect Control: Some natural plant washes contain ingredients with natural insecticidal properties. These ingredients can help deter pests and reduce the likelihood of insect infestations on the plants. While they may not eliminate all pests, they can provide an additional layer of protection without the use of synthetic pesticides. Gentle and Non-Toxic: Natural plant washes are typically gentle on plants and do not cause harm or toxicity when used as directed. They are formulated to be safe for the plant's foliage and can be used throughout the flowering stage without adversely affecting the buds' development or taste. Environmental Sustainability: By choosing a natural plant wash, you contribute to a more sustainable approach to cultivation of the plant. These products are often biodegradable and have minimal impact on soil, water, and surrounding ecosystems. They offer an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides that can have negative environmental consequences. It's important to note that while natural plant washes can be beneficial for removing dust, debris, and pests, they are not a substitute for proper cultivation practices, including good hygiene, proper airflow, and pest prevention measures. This is a beneficial substance to plants. Non Food Production Use A product of any of the following types, intended only to aid the growth of desirable plants, is not a “plant regulator” under section 2(v) of FIFRA, and therefore is not a pesticide: A soil amendment product containing a substance or substances intended for the purpose of improving soil characteristics favorable for plant growth.",GREASE,,pest_control,"pest_control, brand:GREASE",TRUE,,,,,,,,3834,shopify,0,continue,manual,75.97,,TRUE,TRUE,0850018213134,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GreenLabel1Lcopy-1-scaled.webp,1,Green Label * WASH,FALSE,Green Label * WASH,GREEN LABEL - CANNA PLANT WASH Canna Building Blocks The Green Label is a gem for the industrial production of the plant.

grow-grease-fermented-vegetative-plant-juice,Grow Grease * Fermented Vegetative Plant Juice,"FERMENTED VEGETATIVE CANNA PLANT JUICE - VIGOROUS GROWTH FPJ- Fermented canna plant juice Fermented vegetative canna plants naturally bioavailable to enhance growth. Grow Grease is an all natural canna fermentation to capture the vegetative juices within. Contains natural grow vitamins, enzymes, amino acid, sugars, minerals, and complex growth biology. Made fresh with top quality ingredients to stimulate growth. Harvested at peak juvenile stage to incapsulate vigorous growth. Cost-effective and nutrient rich ferment, highly compatible with ALL fertilizers. If using as your base nutrient, DOUBLE the drench recommended rate on the bottle or feed chart. Nutrient Source: Fermentation breaks down organic matter and releases nutrients in a bioavailable form. By fermenting cannabis plant parts, you can create a nutrient-rich liquid that can be used as a natural fertilizer for cannabis plants. The fermentation process helps release essential macronutrients (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and micronutrients (such as iron, zinc, and calcium) that are beneficial for plant growth. Microbial Activity: Fermentation involves the activity of beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, which can contribute to the overall health of the plants. These microorganisms help break down complex organic compounds, improve soil structure, and enhance nutrient availability. Applying fermented plant juice to the soil can introduce these beneficial microorganisms, which can promote the growth of cannabis plants and enhance their resilience against pests and diseases. Plant Growth Stimulant: Fermented plant juice contains organic acids, enzymes, and plant growth regulators that can stimulate plant growth and development. These compounds can enhance root development, increase nutrient uptake efficiency, and improve overall plant vigor. The application of fermented plant juice as a foliar spray or soil drench can provide these growth-promoting benefits to cannabis plants. Organic and Sustainable: Fermented plant juice is a natural and organic option for fertilizing cannabis plants. It allows for the recycling and utilization of plant waste materials, reducing waste and promoting sustainability in cultivation practices. Using fermented plant juice aligns with organic farming principles and can be an eco-friendly choice for cannabis growers. Cost-Effective: Fermented plant juice can be made using readily available plant materials, such as cannabis leaves, stems, and branches, which are often considered waste products. By utilizing these plant parts and fermenting them into a nutrient-rich liquid, growers can reduce the need for purchasing expensive synthetic fertilizers, thereby lowering cultivation costs.",Grow Grease,,nutrients,"nutrients, brand:Grow Grease",TRUE,,,,,,,,3834,shopify,0,continue,manual,29.97,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GrowGreasecopy-1-scaled.webp,1,Grow Grease * Fermented Vegetative Plant Juice,FALSE,Grow Grease * Fermented Vegetative Plant Juice,FERMENTED VEGETATIVE CANNA PLANT JUICE - VIGOROUS GROWTH FPJ- Fermented canna plant juice Fermented vegetative canna plants naturally bioavailable to enhance gr,lb,,active

herculean-harvest,Herculean Harvest,"<p>Hercules was known for his strength and power: a perfect name for a product that gives your plants just that. Herculean Harvest increases the availability of calcium and phosphorus to your plants and soil, producing a wide range of benefits to plant health, structure and flavor, contributing to a vigorous soil food web and improving accessibility of nutrients. The active ingredient in bone meal, calcium phosphate, helps to carry all nutrients to the plant, except for nitrogen and potassium. Calcium is essential for supplying plant growth energy in order to sustain life and growth, and promotes solid stems through stronger cell development. Calcium also increases the cation exchange capacity of soils, making nutrients more available to microbial activity and ultimately to the plant. The addition of Herculean Harvest to any nutrient line will increase size, aroma and flavor of the plants’ fruit. It also aides in washing salt from a potting soil or soilless medium, and can be used as part of a soil flush solution.</p> <p>Also known as Liquid Bone Meal by Harvest Moon Organics</p>",Nickel City Wholesale Garden Supply,,nutrients,"nutrients, catalog_index; nutrients, brand:Nectar",TRUE,Size,Quart,,,,,hmh01394,2268,shopify,0,deny,manual,12.32,,TRUE,TRUE,0812863010283,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Herculean.jpg,1,Herculean Harvest,FALSE,Herculean Harvest,Hercules was known for his strength and power: a perfect name for a product that gives your plants just that.

The role of the stomata’s is to catch nutrients and moisture from above. Applying foliar prays is an additional way to get food into the plant, by passing the root zone and directly feeding the plant. High performance nutrients are expensive and no-one likes to see them go to waste. The state of the art binding agents present in Humboldt Sticky create a microscopic bond between your plant’s leaves and your nutrient solution, using all-natural biochemical processes which do not damage plant tissue, nor induce plant stress. With Humboldt Sticky your foliar sprays are fully utilized by the plant, eliminating waste or overfeeding. By equally distributing the heavier elements of your foliar spray (micro-nutrients, trace elements, etc) throughout the solution, your favorite plants receive more complete, healthy and useful nutrition.

On one hand, our selected Mimosa from Symbiotic Genetics, which has those deep floral perfumes that the king loves so much, and on the other hand our famous King’s Kush, with its citrusy potency. What came out is an outstanding plant with a beautiful coney/piney type of growth and a long main cola that will grow a bit higher than the sides and allow the secondary branches to make a beautiful crown around it. The plants will have quite a stretch during flowering time—you can expect them at least to double in size during the first weeks of flowering, with steady branches and vigorous growth. The flowers have an amazing smell that balances perfectly the floral of the Mimosa with the extra citrusy/earthy touch of the Kush ancestors, which gives us an amazingly complex fragrance that resembles some kind of fresh fruit juice, alongside some beautiful colors at the end of flowering, most of the plants will take some beautiful reddish/violet hues toward the end of flowering, which makes it a very beautiful plant once it is covered in trichomes with the colors of fall: an amazing sight. </div> </div> </div>",,,seeds,"catalog_index; seeds, brand:H Moon Hydro",TRUE,,,,,,,,113,shopify,0,continue,manual,45.00,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KINGS-JUICECORRECT_.jpg||https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OIP.webp,1,King's Juice (Feminised) Mimosa x King's Kush-5 Seed,FALSE,King's Juice (Feminised) Mimosa x King's Kush-5 Seed,Description 60% SATIVA - 40% INDICA Genetics Mimosa x King's Kush Hemp Seed Certificate Of Analysis Indoor Flowering Cycle : 9-10 weeks Yield : Medium - High Ou,lb,,active

The micro-organisms in this concentrate are dormant with a long shelf life because of the micro-encapsulating solution.

meet-source-turbo,Meet Source Turbo,"The Source Turbo: Helping people understand why the Source Turbo is special and why what it does is important is one of the most challenging missions ExtractCraft faces as a company. In general terms, the Source Turbo is an appliance that allows anyone to perform home ethanol extraction easily and safely, using botanical materials like lavender, sandalwood, hops, and mushrooms for anything you’d like to use in culinary arts, scenting, smoking, vaping, and medicine making. The Source Turbo produces incredible, high-quality concentrates that will amaze you from the first try. More specifically, the Source Turbo is an advanced piece of extraction equipment with capabilities normally found only in a lab but designed to feel familiar in the home and fit comfortably on the kitchen counter. It is a combination of internal vacuum generation and heat delivery specifically tuned for low-temperature ethanol evaporation, incorporating an outer containment serving triple duty as a vacuum chamber, cold trap, and collection vessel controlled by a system so technologically advanced that operation requires only the push of a single green button. The Source Turbo is designed for small-batch countertop extraction. The unit can be loaded with a liquid volume of about 300 ml. Depending on the material, that equates to processing about an ounce of dry material and producing a few grams of concentrate. It’s perfect for the hobbyist or test kitchen. It’s a lot of science bundled in a small package. You can’t forget the app these days. The Source Turbo has a great mobile app to monitor estimated content temperature, vacuum level, current altitude setting, and time remaining until auto-shutoff. Using the app is optional and not required for the unit's operation, so those who don’t want to do so don’t have to. <strong>HOW THE SOURCE TURBO OPERATES</strong> The Source Turbo performs the important operation of evaporating and purging ethanol in the ethanol extraction process. Traditionally, evaporation for at-home extraction has been accomplished by allowing ethanol to evaporate slowly for a couple of days or boiling it in an open atmosphere with high heat. Neither of those options is good because natural evaporation takes far too long, and boiling off ethanol with high heat destroys the most flavorful and aromatic elements of an extraction, thus destroying quality. Most concerning, both options fill the surrounding air with combustible fumes, which is wasteful and dangerous. The Source Turbo is designed to address and eliminate those problems. The Source Turbo is a self-contained closed-loop system that solves old ethanol evaporation problems without cumbersome, difficult-to-use, expensive lab equipment. Vacuum technology and advanced system controls evaporate ethanol around 100°F. The very low operational temperatures preserve the most delicate attributes of an extraction, creating the most high-quality, potent oil possible. Using a combination of vacuum, heat, and outside ambient temperature, the vacuum chamber becomes a “cold-trap” and collection vessel to reclaim evaporated ethanol for reuse. Reclaiming ethanol for reuse keeps the dangerous fumes from filling the surroundings, saves significant money with every use, and eliminates waste. When the extraction process is completed, the pure oil concentrate remains in the crucible, and the clean reclaimed ethanol is separated in the collector.",Meet Source,,extraction,"extraction, brand:Meet Source",TRUE,,,,,,,,6804,shopify,0,continue,manual,600.00,659.00,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/turbo-1200x1200.webp,,Meet Source Turbo,FALSE,Meet Source Turbo,The Source Turbo: Helping people understand why the Source Turbo is special and why what it does is important is one of the most challenging missions ExtractCra,lb,,active

The calyx is large, buds grow irregular in shape and tend to slight fox-tailing. The Money Maker makes very compact, heavy flower clusters, and it has very low leaf-to-calyx ratio so manicuring is very easy.

og-grease-trace-booster,OG Grease * Trace Booster,"OCEAN GROWN MINERALS - TRACE BOOSTER Seawater Extract = Flavor Unique ocean grown trace minerals to maximize aromas. OG Grease contains the most complete trace minerals content from a unique single source. The use of seawater for plant growth has been practiced for centuries.This agricultural technique, known as ""seawater irrigation"" or ""saltwater irrigation,"" involves using diluted seawater as a natural fertilizer and soil amendment. The practice has shown several benefits, and a similar phenomenon was observed in Sri Lanka after the fields were flooded with ocean water from the tsunami. Mineral Enrichment: Seawater is rich in minerals and trace elements, including potassium, magnesium, and various micronutrients. When diluted and applied to agricultural fields, these minerals can replenish soil fertility and provide essential nutrients for plant growth. This is especially beneficial for crops grown in soil that may be deficient in certain minerals. Salt Tolerance: Some plants, particularly certain varieties of rice and salt-tolerant crops, have adapted to grow in saline conditions. By using diluted seawater, these crops can utilize the nutrients present in seawater while tolerating the salinity. This enables farmers in coastal areas to cultivate crops in soil that may otherwise be unsuitable for conventional agriculture. Pest and Disease Control: Excellent alternative to pesticides, fungicides, and insecticides. Seawater contains natural substances that may help control certain pests and diseases, reducing the need for chemical pesticides and fungicides. This aligns with the principles of sustainable and organic agriculture. Excellent addition to an Integrated Pest Management routine. Soil Improvement: Seawater irrigation can help improve soil structure and increase its water-holding capacity. The minerals in seawater can aid in soil aggregation, enhancing soil fertility and moisture retention. This can be particularly advantageous in regions with sandy or infertile soils, where water and nutrient retention are crucial for successful crop growth.",,,nutrients,"catalog_index; nutrients, brand:Unknown",TRUE,,,,,,,,3834,shopify,0,continue,manual,19.97,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Atlas-Seed-Grease-Gun-7-1200x1449.webp,,OG Grease * Trace Booster,FALSE,OG Grease * Trace Booster,OCEAN GROWN MINERALS - TRACE BOOSTER Seawater Extract = Flavor Unique ocean grown trace minerals to maximize aromas.

Plantacillin's non-clogging, non-abrasive liquid formulation also includes a food source to ensure the survival of the GB03 once they are applied. Plantacillin is 100% natural, and contains no chemicals. What does this mean for you and your plants? Well, to start with, you'll get some secondary benefits that you wouldn't when using chemicals. For instance, it is a known fact that the use of chemical products will actually prune the roots of your plants. In stark contrast to chemical fungicides, Plantacillin actually encourages stronger, denser root mass and length! That is because Bacillus subtilis GB03 excretes auxin-like substances that encourage such growth. The product is also easy to use.

purple-label-indica,Purple Label * Indica,"PURPLE LABEL - INDICA Indica Building Blocks GREASE Purple Label is a special blend that is naturally purple. The Purple blend is specialized for Indicas and short flowering plants including Auto-Flowers. The proprietary blend has excellent bioavailability to line up with exotic strains. Grease Purple Label bridges the gap and harnesses the building blocks of Indica resins back on the Indica plant itself. All Grease Label products work to increase resin, but when you align the source material with the target crop, the efficiency goes up resulting in the maximum yield of unique and targeted compounds. Physical Appearance: Indica plants typically have a shorter and bushier stature compared to Sativa plants. They have broad, dark green leaves and dense, compact buds. Indica strains are known for their ability to thrive in cooler climates and have a shorter flowering time compared to Sativas. Effects: Indica strains are commonly associated with relaxing and sedating effects. They are known to provide a ""body high"" that promotes relaxation, stress relief, and can potentially induce feelings of calmness and tranquility. Indica strains are often chosen for their potential therapeutic benefits in alleviating pain, muscle spasms, insomnia, and anxiety. Cannabinoid Profile: This cannabinoid profile contributes to their more calming and physically relaxing effects. Aromas and Flavors: Indica strains often exhibit a wide range of aromatic profiles, including earthy, fruity, floral, and sometimes even skunky or pungent aromas. The flavors of indica strains can also vary, with some being sweet, spicy, or herbal. Growing Characteristics: Indica strains are generally known for their resilience and adaptability to various growing conditions. They are often preferred by indoor growers due to their compact size and shorter flowering period. Indica plants have a higher yield potential and can produce dense, resinous buds. This is a beneficial substance to plants.

We combined two sativa dominant strain, one of which is our all-time classic Super Lemon Haze with its long and dense flowers covered in trichomes, and the second One being the GMO from Mamiko Seeds, one of the most different smells with its complex mix of garlic-onion-mushroom notes. The mix of both resulted in a very strong and vigorous plant with dense, long and compact flowers with huge calyxes like the GMO, and a whole layer of trichomes covering the surface of the flowers will make it a very sticky plant. It is recommended to have a little bit of experience to grow this plant, as it has a pretty long flowering time to get the full expression of the plant and will require adequate feeding. Some of the most rewarding plants will take up to 11 weeks, but the result is worth the wait, with strong thick stems shooting flower sites everywhere. <span class=""product-title-hybrid"">Awards</span> Not yet introduced. </div> </div> </div>",Super Lemon,,seeds,"catalog_index; seeds, brand:H Moon Hydro",TRUE,,,,,,,,113,shopify,0,continue,manual,70.00,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SLHaze-x-GMO_.jpg||https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OIP.webp,1,Super Lemon Haze x GMO (Feminised) -5 Seed,FALSE,Super Lemon Haze x GMO (Feminised) -5 Seed,Description &nbsp; 60% SATIVA - 40% INDICA Genetics Super Lemon Haze x GMO Hemp Seed Certificate Of Analysis Taste The aromas are very potent and pungent from t,lb,,active

There’s no need to introduce Super Lemon Haze—the queen of all lemon strains and a staple in our industry. This time, we combined it with Pink Candy, a cross of Pink Panties X Candy Kush, which produces one of the sweetest and most intense cotton candy aromas we've ever encountered. The beautiful blend of cotton candy notes, with a hint of Kush in the background, brings light earthy and mossy undertones, creating a stunning flavor profile. The result is a beautiful and vigorous plant that grows long and tall secondary branches that can compete with the main stem and support compact flowers covered in a sticky and thick layer of trichomes. The shape of the flowers is a perfect mix of both parents, predominantly resembling the structure of Super Lemon Haze but with the compactness and resin production of Pink Candy, which also produces excellent hash. <span class=""product-title-hybrid"">Awards</span> Not yet introduced. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>",Super Lemon,,seeds,"catalog_index; seeds, brand:H Moon Hydro",TRUE,,,,,,,,113,shopify,0,continue,manual,70.00,,TRUE,TRUE,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0672/5730/3114/files/29dd0613__lemon-haze-pink-candy-100x100_jpg.webp?v=1766353450,1,Super Lemon Haze x Pink Candy Super Lemon Haze x Pink Candy- 5 Seed,FALSE,Super Lemon Haze x Pink Candy Super Lemon Haze x Pink Candy- 5 Seed,Super Lemon Haze x Pink Candy Super Lemon Haze x Pink Candy &nbsp; Description &nbsp; 60% SATIVA - 40% INDICA Genetics Super Lemon Haze x Pink Candy Hemp Seed C,lb,,active

Teaming with Fungi is the first book to accessibly explain the essential symbiotic relationship between soil-dwelling mycorrhizal fungi and plants. Almost every plant in a garden forms a relationship with fungi, and many plants would not exist without their fungal partners.

teaming-with-microbes,Teaming with Microbes,"<b>A Gardener's Guide to the Soil Food Web</b><br> by Jeff Lowenfels and Wayne Lewis <br><br> <b>Should be required reading for all serious gardeners.</b> <br><br> Smart gardeners know that soil is anything but an inert substance. Healthy soil is teeming with life not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants, and thus become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial substances, many of them toxic to humans as well as other forms of life. But there is an alternative to this vicious circle: to garden in a way that strengthens, rather than destroys, the soil food web the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. By eschewing jargon and overly technical language, the authors make the benefits of cultivating the soil food web available to a wide audience, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals.",Nickel City Wholesale Garden Supply,,books,"accessories, books; catalog_index, brand:H Moon Hydro",TRUE,,,,,,,hmh00001,454,shopify,6,deny,manual,24.39,,TRUE,TRUE,9780881927771,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0672/5730/3114/files/9901e240__teaming_with_microbes.jpg?v=1766352368,1,Teaming with Microbes,FALSE,Teaming with Microbes,A Gardener's Guide to the Soil Food Web by Jeff Lowenfels and Wayne Lewis Should be required reading for all serious gardeners.

To fully understand how plants eat, Lowenfels uses his ability to make science accessible with lessons in the biology, chemistry, and botany all gardeners need to understand how nutrients get to the plant and what they do once they're inside the plant.</li> <li>Teaming with Nutrients will open your eyes to the importance of understanding the role of nutrients in healthy, productive organic gardens and it will show you how these nutrients do their jobs.

Trimpro has introduced their first hand-operated trimming machine. The TRIMPRO UNPLUGGED. Designed similar to the famous Trimpro Rotors, although a little smaller, the economical machine is perfect for the smaller grower that needs a great trimmer at an affordable price. The smaller size makes the trimmer very portable. The hand crank operates a system of gears that enables the fingers that rotate the product at a slower speed than the trimming blades spinning below. This results in complete speed control. With the adjustable blade height, you can customize the final product to match your specifications. Minimum effort is needed to operate the trimmer.

Finally, something safe to apply as a drench and spray during flush. Watch your plants pray to the end. The aromas that you and the plants experience when spraying are particularly enjoyable. It can be used on any variety at any time, but is intended for the final finishing phase. Grease Yellow Label bridges the gap and harnesses the building blocks of finishing resins back on the finishing plant itself. All Grease Label products work to increase resin, but when you align the source material with the target crop, the efficiency goes up resulting in the maximum yield of unique desired compounds. The final growth phase of cannabis during the last two weeks before harvest is a critical period known as the ""flushing"" or ""ripening"" phase. This phase is characterized by specific practices aimed at enhancing the final quality of the buds. Here are some key aspects of the final growth phase: Nutrient Reduction: During the final growth phase, it's common to reduce or completely stop the use of nutrient supplements. This gradual reduction ensures that the plant's nutrient uptake decreases, which can help prevent excess nutrients from remaining in the buds and affecting the taste and quality. Trichome Development: Trichomes are tiny resin glands that develop on the surface of the buds, leaves, and stems of the cannabis plant. These trichomes contain cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds that contribute to the potency and aroma of the final product. During the last two weeks, the trichomes reach their peak development, indicating the ideal time for harvest. You can monitor the trichomes using a magnifying tool and harvest when they appear milky or amber in color. Ripening Signs: As the plant nears maturity, you may observe certain ripening signs. The pistils, the hair-like structures on the buds, may change color from white to orange, brown, or red. The buds may become denser, and the leaves may start to yellow and wither. These are natural signs of the plant's final growth phase. Proper Environmental Conditions: During the last two weeks, it's crucial to maintain appropriate environmental conditions. Maintain the proper temperature and humidity levels to prevent mold or bud rot. Adequate airflow and ventilation are also important to minimize the risk of any moisture-related issues. Flushing: Flushing refers to the practice of watering plants with plain water, without any nutrients or additives. The purpose of flushing is to remove any residual nutrients or chemical buildup from the plant's tissues. By flushing, you allow the plant to consume its stored nutrients, resulting in a cleaner and smoother smoke. This is a beneficial substance to plants.
