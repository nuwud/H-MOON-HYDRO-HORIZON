13163,"Teaming with Microbes","<b>A Gardener's Guide to the Soil Food Web</b><br>  by Jeff Lowenfels and Wayne Lewis  <br><br>  <b>Should be required reading for all serious gardeners.</b>  <br><br>  Smart gardeners know that soil is anything but an inert substance. Healthy soil is teeming with life not just earthworms and insects, but a staggering multitude of bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. When we use chemical fertilizers, we injure the microbial life that sustains healthy plants, and thus become increasingly dependent on an arsenal of artificial substances, many of them toxic to humans as well as other forms of life. But there is an alternative to this vicious circle: to garden in a way that strengthens, rather than destroys, the soil food web the complex world of soil-dwelling organisms whose interactions create a nurturing environment for plants. By eschewing jargon and overly technical language, the authors make the benefits of cultivating the soil food web available to a wide audience, from devotees of organic gardening techniques to weekend gardeners who simply want to grow healthy, vigorous plants without resorting to chemicals.",,"2019-09-03 19:20:27",product,teaming-with-microbes,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/teaming-with-microbes/,,,Books,,simple,visible,No,Domestic,No,,,instock,no,no,24.95,,"Thanks you for your order!",1,0,0,0,hmh00001,,,24.95,yes,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,large,,,,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/teaming_with_microbes.jpg,teaming_with_microbes.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/teaming_with_microbes.jpg,872,teaming_with_microbes,,,,,,,,,,,,1,nuwud,nuwud@nuwudmultimedia.com,Patrick,Wood,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043134058570"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665876193354"",""status"":""imported""}}",,,,,import-placeholder-for-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2024-09-16 00:38:42"

Despite the low level of nutrients found in natural soil-based environments, plant growth nevertheless occurs because the smallest humic acids channel available nutrients directly into nearby vegetation. By accelerating nutrient absorption at the root boundary zone where minerals enter the plant, small particle sized humic acids optimize nutrient uptake in fast growing vegetation. Diamond Nectar™ applies the magic of the smallest available humic acids to nutrient rich hydroponic environments by grabbing these nutrient minerals and transporting them into plant roots for faster growth and higher yields. Diamond Nectar™ supercharges your nutrients in order to optimize the health of your plants and the quality of your crops.

13189,"FloraDuo Complete","<b>FloraDuo Complete, concentrated and cost effective.<br>  FloraDuo is a new formula derived from the latest scientific discoveries</b>  <br><br>  FloraDuo is a ""classic"" mineral nutrient, with a difference (and an essential one), where each of the elements a plant needs is derived from a large variety of different sources. To create an excellent nutrient, you need of course a precise formula. But this is not all! It also is very important that each element comes from different sources, and different salts. This is how they are made available at all times, in a form plants can absorb them. And we don't stop at that. We add in our bottle elements we could call ""bio-activators"", that are not directly nutrients for plants, but which improve their general health, help them better absorb their food, and better resist to pathogen and insect aggressions.  <br><br>  FloraDuo is a complete nutrient, especially designed for fast growing plants, with a marked difference between growth and flowering needs. It comes in 2 parts: FloraDuo Grow and FloraDuo Bloom. it to all regions, FloraDuo is highly concentrated : 4 ml/L are enough for a balanced and vigorous growth. Its price also is very attractive.  <br><br>  FloraDuo is economical and cost effective. FloraDuo is also user-friendly : by mixing 3 parts FloraDuo Grow with 1 part FloraDuo Bloom, you'll address all growth requirements. Then, by reversing these proportions (3 parts Bloom with 1 part Grow), you'll attend to all fl owering needs. FloraDuo guarantees a perfect balance between growing and flowering. You need nothing else for abundant and healthy yields. Like for all our nutrients, FloraDuo is an exhaustive formula: no need for complements to improve your plants diet. It includes 30 years of studies and experience, from our years collaborating with research laboratories (particularly with the University of California at Davis), and also thanks to the information provided by thousands of people using our products worldwide.",,"2019-09-03 19:20:31",product,floraduo-complete,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/floraduo-complete/,"General Hydroponics",,"Nutrients &amp; Supplements > Spray N Grow",,grouped,visible,No,Domestic,No,"FloraDuo A 16 oz|~|FloraDuo A 1 qt|~|FloraDuo A 1 gal|~|FloraDuo A 2.5 gal|~|FloraDuo A 6 gal|~|FloraDuo B 16 oz|~|FloraDuo B 1 qt|~|FloraDuo B 1 gal|~|FloraDuo B 2.5 gal|~|FloraDuo B 6 gal",,instock,no,no,,,"Thanks you for your order!",0,12,12,12,hmh00026,,,11.09||170,yes,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,large,,,,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/flora-duo.jpg,flora-duo.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/flora-duo.jpg,364,flora-duo,,,,,,,,,,,,1,nuwud,nuwud@nuwudmultimedia.com,Patrick,Wood,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,import-placeholder-for-26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2024-09-16 00:39:12"

Our scientists have formulated FloraNectar to optimize the greatest transference of sweetness and aroma into your fruits and flowers.

FloraNectar contains all natural raw cane sugar, molasses, malt syrup, select plant based esters, L-amino acids, organic acids, polyflavonoids, vitamins and essential minerals.

This unique blend of ingredients helps your plants regulate enzymes that trigger specific reactions involved in maintaining optimal metabolism. This allows your plants to achieve a balance between respiration and photosynthesis in high intensity growing environments where the rate of respiration can sometimes exceed the rate of photosynthesis.

As a result, FloraNectar ensures optimal metabolic rates during the flowering and fruiting phase when nitrogen levels have been reduced.

FloraNectar also promotes a sturdier plant structure during the vegetative phase when high levels of nitrogen are present.

Roots are necessary to the plant to provide a continuous supply of water, sugars, and mineral nutrients. The larger the root system, the more dynamically the plant can function and grow. B’Cuzz Root Stimulator will initiate an explosive root production. A cutting is an exact replica of the host or parent plant, however, a cutting is still a vegetative plant. It takes time to change the cutting's train of thought from growing to rooting. The rooting formula will supplement this change.

<b>Mayan MicroZyme</b> (MMZ) mineralizes nutrients; produces nitrogen, natural antibiotics and plant growth hormones; regulates nitrogen; builds soil organic matter; suppresses soil and plant pathogens; and improves fertility, yields, and nutrient availability and uptake.

The micro-organisms in this concentrate are dormant with a long shelf life because of the micro-encapsulating solution. When the concentrate is diluted in water and aerated, the micro-encapsulation dissolves and the micro-organism populations become active and increase in number.

<b>DIRECTIONS:</b>

<b>STEP 1: FERMENTATION </b>

Dilute 2 fluid ounces of Mayan MicroZyme CONCENTRATE per gallon of NON-CHLORINATED water. Add 5 Tablespoons of molasses, sugar or complex carbohydrates to mixture for every 2 ounces of concentrate. Aerate/agitate for 3 to 7 days in a bucket, compost tea brewer, or reservoir. For shorter activation time, maintain water temperature at 80 degrees.

<b>STEP 2:</b> DILUTION RATES for APPLICATION

<b>SOIL:</b> Add 1 gallon of Mayan MicroZyme <b>fermented</b> mixture (step 1) to every 30 gallons in nutrient reservoir <b>OR undiluted fermented mixture</b> can be sprayed directly on the soil surface immediately preceding irrigation with fertilizers.

<b>HYDROPONIC:</b> Add 1 gallon of MMZ <b>fermented</b> mixture (step 1) to every 30 gallons of nutrient reservoir.

<b>HYDROPONIC EBB and FLOW SYSTEMS:</b> Add 2 mL of <b>straight concentrate</b> from bottle (DO NOT DILUTE) per gallon to the reservoir in the ebb and flow system.

<b>FOLIAR SPRAY:</b> As a mold and pathogenic preventative, spray <b>fermented</b> mixture (step 1) onto the leaves until runoff occurs. Be sure spraying device is clean. Apply once a week in vegetative stage and first two weeks in bloom.

<b>Content in colonies per milliliter:</b>

Plate count of aerobic bacteria and anerobic bacteria: a minimum of 300,000 CFU/mL for each.

<b>Microorganisms:</b>

<b>Primary:</b> Azotobacter vinelandii and Clostridium pasteurianum.

13316,"Doktor Doom Spider Mite Knock Out","Doktor Doom® Spider Mite Knock Out® is a .20% pyrethrin formula. This formula is 19 times stronger in active ingredient pyrethrin than any soap based insecticides and 10 times stronger than any formulations that contain pyrethrin &amp; piperoynl Butoxide. Piperoynl Butoxide is a synergist which enhances the killing power of pyrethrin and it is not approved for organic gardening. Pyrethrin is approved for organic gardening with some restrictions - refer to OMRI (Organic Material Review Institute), for more information.

Unlike soap based products which need to be applied liberally to the plant in order to drown the insects, Doktor Doom® Spider Mite Knock Out® kills the pests on contact with just a light misting on the foliage.

Apply the Doktor Doom® Spider Mite Knock Out® to the underside of the leaves and then fog the room with a Doktor Doom® fogger. The smell of pyrethrin flushes out and eradicates pests on contact.

13868,"Green Air Genesis Calibration Solutions","A whole family of solution to properly care and maintain your testers and meters.  <p>  <b>PH Buffers</b>  <p>  These solutions are used to calibrate pH meters to assure they are accurate and working properly. You should check your pH meter frequently because the properties of the meters membrane is constantly changing from normal use and aging. We recommend a two point calibration between 4.0 and 7.0 to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 4.0 and 7.0. Ask your dealer for PHB-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  <b>PH Electrode Storage Solutions</b>  <p>  Use to store your pH meter electrode between use. This solution is designed to keep your electrode sensing membrane and reference junction clean and unclogged and ready for use. Store you electrode directly in a small cup of solution or saturate a sponge in the cap of your meter for storage between use. This will prevent your permeable glass membrane from becoming dry and from mineral deposits clogging the surface. This solution is designed to equalize the osmotic pressure of the reference solution in your meter junction to keep the reference solution from seeping out and prematurely aging your meter. Should your electrode membrane dry out soak it in this solution for at least two hours before use. NEVER STORE AN ELECTRODE IN DISTILLED OR DEIONIZED WATER. Ask your dealer for Genesis ESS solution.  <p>  <b>TDS and EC Standards</b>  <p>  The Genesis Lab manufactures calibration standards for Total Dissolved Solids and Electrical Conductivity for the purpose of keeping your solution concentration meters reading properly. We recommend a two point calibration between 800 ppm tds (1200 uS) and 1300 ppm tds (2000 uS) to assure that your meter is accurate across the scale. This is why the Genesis solution is available in twin packs of 800 and 1300. Ask your dealer for PPM-T for the twin pack available in 8oz or 16oz sizes.  <p>  Also available in 1500 ppm tds (2.14 mS at 0.7 conv.), 1413 uS, 5000uS, and 12.88 mS. Other values available upon request.  <p>  <b>Electrode and Probe Cleaning Solutions</b>  <p>  Used to clean meter tip. Works for both pH and conductivity meters. Comes as a two part A and B cleaning solution to remove both organic and inorganic deposits from meter sensors. Use monthly or as needed to refresh your meter and keep it working optimum.

13872,"PH / Calibration Solutions","To maximize plant growth, the pH of your nutrients should be slightly acidic. Experienced growers consider the ideal pH for most crops to fall between 5.5 and 6.5. Users of General Hydroponics nutrient products generally do not experience problems maintaining the proper pH range because our formulas are pH buffered. However, some important exceptions do exist. Acid content can reach unacceptable levels when nutrient solutions are mixed with poor quality water, or when pH unstable media – such as rock wool or gravel products – are used, or when high plant growth rates destabilize the nutrient mix due to rapid nutrient absorption by the crop.

      <i>Solution Tester</i>
      <p> General Hydroponics pH Test Kits make pH testing easy. Simply fill a test-tube halfway with nutrient, add a few drops of pH Test Indicator, and observe the coloration of the liquid in the test vial. Many experienced growers prefer our pH Test Kit to expensive electronic meters because of its reliability and ease of use, which are important factors when the health of a valuable crop is at stake. <b>Use 3 drops per 5mL of solution.</b> </td>

PROfilter uses an innovative patented design allowing the user to reverse the filter, benefiting from the use of 100% of the carbon available and effectively extending the units' lifespan. Manufactured with only the finest TC940 virgin 3mm grain sized carbon. PROfilter effectively removes 99.5% of odors rated for a continuous worry-free operation and available in seven different sizes and CFM ratings, PROfilter can be used for commercial or residential applications.

14541,CALiMAGic,"CALiMAGic™ is a low nitrogen calcium magnesium supplement, specially formulated to prevent secondary nutrient deficiencies in fast-growing plants. Many calcium-intensive plants, like lettuce and tomatoes, need that extra Ca+ boost to optimize growth. This prevents diseases related to calcium deficiency like blossom-end rot (a disease that causes the bottom of fruits to rot on the vine). CALiMAGic™ also prevents leaf tip burn: drying and curling leaves due to a shortage of calcium in leaf tissue. Calcium deficiency affects a huge range of plants but can easily be remedied with a little CALiMAGic™!    CALiMAGic™ is a clean, fully soluble product that will not clog spray lines or drip emitters and is safe to use in reservoirs combined with many other fertilizers.  Use CALiMAGic™ as a part of your regular feeding program",,"2019-09-03 20:17:24",product,calimagic,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/calimagic/,"General Hydroponics",,"Nutrients &amp; Supplements > General Hydroponics",,grouped,visible,No,Domestic,No,"CALiMAGic 16oz|~|CALiMAGic qt|~|CALiMAGic gal|~|CALiMAGic 2.5 gal|~|CALiMAGic 6 gal",,instock,no,no,,,"Thanks you for your order!",0,12,12,12,hmh01154,,,12.95||227.5,yes,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'-1,'-1,large,,,default,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/calimagic.jpg,calimagic.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/calimagic.jpg,33758,calimagic,,calimagic,calimagic,,,,,,,,,1,nuwud,nuwud@nuwudmultimedia.com,Patrick,Wood,,,,,,,,,,0,,,no,,,,,,0,,no,,import-placeholder-for-1154,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2024-09-16 01:21:53"

Trimpro has introduced their first hand-operated trimming machine. The TRIMPRO UNPLUGGED. Designed similar to the famous Trimpro Rotors, although a little smaller, the economical machine is perfect for the smaller grower that needs a great trimmer at an affordable price. The smaller size makes the trimmer very portable. The hand crank operates a system of gears that enables the fingers that rotate the product at a slower speed than the trimming blades spinning below. This results in complete speed control. With the adjustable blade height, you can customize the final product to match your specifications. Minimum effort is needed to operate the trimmer. TRIMPRO UNPLUGGED is new standard in hand-operated trimmers! Specifications: Weight: 8 lbs.

TRIMPRO Trimmer! Introducing the NEW TRIMPRO UNPLUGGED™! The First Hand-Operated Trimmer from the Makers of the Best Trimmers in the World. Trimpro has introduced their first hand-operated trimming machine. The TRIMPRO UNPLUGGED. Designed similar to the famous Trimpro Rotors, although a little smaller, the economical machine is perfect for the smaller grower that needs a great trimmer at an affordable price. The smaller size makes the trimmer very portable. The hand crank operates a system of gears that enables the fingers that rotate the product at a slower speed than the trimming blades spinning below. This results in complete speed control. With the adjustable blade height, you can customize the final product to match your specifications. Minimum effort is needed to operate the trimmer. TRIMPRO UNPLUGGED is new standard in hand-operated trimmers! Specifications: Weight: 8 lbs.

14814,"Aphrodite's Extraction","Aphrodite’s Extraction provides a rich blend of sucrose, fructose, chelated nutrients, vitamins, and organic acids to promote a thriving microbial population and strong, healthy plant growth. In addition to calcium, microbes need carbon in order to manufacture complex proteins for normal growth and reproduction: low carbon equals low microbial activity. Sucrose is one of the most available forms of carbon for a plant. When sucrose and fructose are blended with proteins, it becomes a microbial feast. Nutrients in Aphrodite’s Extraction are chelated to increase availability to the plant, promoting photosynthesis, structured soils, and increases in disease resistance and yields.

This blend provides organic acids necessary for enzymatic activity, and a complete balance of vitamins A, C, D, E, B1, B6 and B12, which are essential to plants’ biological growth processes. Additionally, carbon in the soil determines the magnitude of the Earth’s magnetic field’s effect on plants. Greater carbon presence results in greater magnetic influence, which leads to a faster life cycle.

TIP: Customers who use Aphrodite’s Extraction have experienced dramatic flavor improvements when applying it in the last weeks of the plants life cycle. The addition of sugar based calcium allows the plant to process more sugars to improve its ability to procreate. Try using Aphrodite’s Extraction as a food source for compost tea brewing. The blend of proteins, organic acids and sugar from carbon make an excellent food source for a microbial rich tea.",,"2019-09-03 20:28:51",product,aphrodites-extraction,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/aphrodites-extraction/,"Nectar For The Gods",,"Nutrients &amp; Supplements > Nectar For The Gods",,grouped,visible,No,Domestic,No,"Aphrodite&#8217;s Extraction Quart|~|Aphrodite&#8217;s Extraction Gallon",,instock,no,no,,,"Thanks you for your order!",0,12,12,12,hmh01371,,,22||45,yes,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,large,,,,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Aphrodite.jpg,Aphrodite.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Aphrodite.jpg,156,aphrodite,,,,,,,,,,,,1,nuwud,nuwud@nuwudmultimedia.com,Patrick,Wood,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,import-placeholder-for-1371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2024-09-16 01:30:07"

14818,"Athena's Aminas","<p>Every plant needs certain compounds for growth beyond soil, light, water, and CO2. Athena’s Aminas provides a readily available source of amino acids to optimize protein production and allow for maximum growth rates. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are the basic components of living cells. If not readily available, amino acids can be a limiting factor in growth rates. Plants use amino acids present in the soil, and synthesize them from elements sourced from soil, air, and water. However, plants can generally use more amino acids than they can find or synthesize in their natural environment. If amino acids are not abundant, plant growth slows necessarily to match availability of the most limiting factors. By adding an amino acid source, you enable your plants to build proteins as quickly as they are able. When using Athena’s Aminas, you can expect to see faster, healthier growth, resulting in bigger, more vigorous plants and a greater ability to resist pests and disease.</p>  <p>Also known as Amino Blast by Harvest Moon Organics.</p>",,"2019-09-03 20:29:01",product,athenas-aminas,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/athenas-aminas/,"Nectar For The Gods",,"Nutrients &amp; Supplements > Nectar For The Gods",,grouped,visible,No,Domestic,No,"Athena&#8217;s Aminas Quart|~|Athena&#8217;s Aminas Gallon",,instock,no,no,,,"Thanks you for your order!",0,12,12,12,hmh01374,,,15||45,yes,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,large,,,,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Aphrodite1.jpg,Aphrodite1.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Aphrodite1.jpg,157,aphrodite,,,,,,,,,,,,1,nuwud,nuwud@nuwudmultimedia.com,Patrick,Wood,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,import-placeholder-for-1374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2024-09-16 01:30:14"

Calcium is the “queen-king” of all nutrients, aiding enzymatic action, feeding soil microbes, improving nutrient availability and cell wall integrity, encouraging solid stem growth (vs. hollow in a calcium-deficient situation) and preventing stem breakage.

Herculean Harvest increases the availability of calcium and phosphorus to your plants and soil, producing a wide range of benefits to plant health, structure and flavor, contributing to a vigorous soil food web and improving accessibility of nutrients. The active ingredient in bone meal, calcium phosphate, helps to carry all nutrients to the plant, except for nitrogen and potassium. Calcium is essential for supplying plant growth energy in order to sustain life and growth, and promotes solid stems through stronger cell development. Calcium also increases the cation exchange capacity of soils, making nutrients more available to microbial activity and ultimately to the plant. The addition of Herculean Harvest to any nutrient line will increase size, aroma and flavor of the plants’ fruit.

15215,"Pure Clean Natural Enzymes","<p>Pure Clean Powerful natural enzymes    <li>Pure Clean is a soil and rhizosphere improver based on natural enzymes.   <p>This product allows for the accelerated decomposition of dead plant materials, which then releases extra nutrients and stimulates substrate life. Pure Clean also increases aerobic capacity and protects plants against diseases. This means that negative disease causing pathogens are proactively eliminated through the use of these special enzymes.  Pure Clean is suspended in a specific sucrose based solution.  <p> This sugar is essential to the health and quality of the enzymes. Uniquely, this carbohydrate based solution will NOT increase negative microbial activity. Instead, the enzymes are able to go to work immediately in the contaminated system and help “purify and clean” the rhizosphere  <p>Why use Pure Clean  <li>Healthy rhizosphere throughout vegetative and blooming phases.  <li>Protects against the buildup of harmful salts and waste compounds.  <li>Increases aerobic capacity in the root system.  <li>Reduces the risk of infection from soil borne diseases.  <li>(3) Specific enzyme profiles: cellulase, beta-glucanase, and pectinase.  <p>How to use Pure Clean  <p>Shake well before use. Add up to 4 ML per GAL of water or nutrient solution. Do NOT use with Green Sensation as an overabundance of enzymes is more costly.  Tip: Pure Clean may be used to rejuvenate depleted or diseased growing substrates. Remove as much plant matter i.e. roots, leaves, stems, etc. from the substrate as possible. Saturate the used growing media at a rate of up to 16 ML per GAL of clean water.

The result allows aromatic and flavor profiles of blooms, flowers and fruits to be significantly enhanced.  <p>One signature aspect of the amino acid profile contained in Royal Rush is a significant reduction in the overall flowering cycle to harvest. This effect is created by signaling to the plant system that environmental stress is incurring, and as a protective effort the plant must increase essential oil and resin content on the plant surface in order to protect itself. Healthy plants that boast vigorous development in optimal conditions may reduce overall production time by as much as one week!  <p>Why use Royal Rush  <li>Increase and enhance the overall essential oil and brix content.  <li>Promotes more essential element availability to the plant  <li>Stimulates chlorophyll production within the plant  <li>Shortens the production cycle thus increasing the amounts of harvests annually.",,"2019-09-03 20:46:27",product,plagron-royal-rush,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/plagron-royal-rush/,,,"Nutrients &amp; Supplements > plagron",,grouped,visible,No,Domestic,No,"Plagron Royal Rush 500 ML|~|Plagron Royal Rush 1 Liter",,instock,no,no,,,"Thanks you for your order!",0,12,12,12,hmh01677,,,70.85||109,yes,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,large,,,,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-008-Royal-Rush.jpg,image-008-Royal-Rush.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-008-Royal-Rush.jpg,513,image-008-Royal-Rush,,,,,,,,,,,,1,nuwud,nuwud@nuwudmultimedia.com,Patrick,Wood,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,import-placeholder-for-1677,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2024-09-16 01:40:49"

All of these come together to create a much healthier plant while enhancing the natural characteristics of each specific plant.   How do we do it?   <p>The Tri-phosphor bulbs are designed for optimum performance with the Fulham Race Horse ballast. These are tuned for max output with the Bad Boy.  <li. The BadBoy coupled with Fulham's Race Horse ballasts put out 28% more light than the competitions fixtures with the NO additional power consumption!  <li> The real trick to the unit is it will give up to 50% more lumens at 6"" and 1' away from the plants. This is a big change. The lumens are driven more consistent farther away from the fixture.   <li>Finally Full Cycle lights for year round production (BADBOY Triphosphor) HO 54W.

To 277V. 50HZ. Or 60HZ.   <li>Where size, output, performance, and production meet.   <li>Vented Reflector - Eliminate the heat. Drive the lumens and not the heat.   <li>Vented Ballast housing: Keeps ballast running cool and extends ballast life.   <li.Unique Lamp spacing- more uniform and panel light, better than HPS point light.   <li>U.S.A.

15306,"Clonex Root Maximizer - Granular/ for soil applications","<p>Clonex Root Maximizer - Granular/ for soil applications  <p><b>This product is designed to be used in a soil system as a dry application. Endomycorrhizae have been shown to benefit over 90% of all plants.  <p>The Clonex brand; including Clonex Gel, Clonex Clone Solution and Clonex Mist, has been the world leader in plant propagation for nearly 30 years with billions of clones successfully rooted.  <p>Clonex Root Maximizer is the newest addition to the Clonex family and is the result of over a decade of dedicated research into mycorrhiza, the specialized beneficial root fungus that assists in the absorption of minerals and water from the soil.  <p>Mycorrhizae actually increase the surface area of plant roots, which allows the plant to reach nutrients and water that might not be available otherwise. Put simply, mycorrhizae extends the plant’s reach, allowing it to get to more of what it needs to survive. The fungus is actually a network of filaments that grow in and around the plant root cells, forming a mass that extends considerably beyond the plant’s root system. This makes the plant stronger and more resistant to stress. Mycorrhizae even protect their host plant against unwanted pathogens.  Clonex Root Maximizer puts life into your soil by adding bountiful amounts of mycorrhizae fungi, beneficial bacteria and Trichoderma that combine to improve the health and vitality of plants.  <li>Treating your young plants with Clonex Root Maximizer will give them the head start needed to reach their genetic potential leading to better quality and higher yields.  <p>Directions for Use  <li>For Transplants: Apply product directly in contact with plant roots. For larger plants (3 gallon pots and larger) apply 2 tablespoons (30ml) per plant. For smaller plants (less than 3 gallon pots), apply 1 teaspoon (5ml) per plant.  <li>For Planting Seeds: Apply product in the furrow beneath the seed at the rate of 1 tablespoon (15ml) per row foot, or broadcast at the rate of 2 tablespoons (30ml) per square foot and rake into the upper soil layer before planting.  <p>Storage  <p>Store in a cool dry place with prolonged temperatures not exceeding 90 F (32.2 C).   <li>Avoid direct sunlight.  <li>Product should be used in a well-ventilated place.  <p>GRANULAR/Soil-Soiless  <li>Glomus intraradices.........104 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus deserticola...........9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus etunicatum...........9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus clarum................. 9 propagules/gm  <li>Glomus claroideum...........9 propagules/gm   <li>Gigaspora albida...............9 propagules/gm  <li>Trichoderma harzianum....145,000 CFU/gm  <li>Bacillus brevis...................98,000 CFU/gm  <li>Bacillus subtilis.................115,000 CFU/gm",,"2019-09-03 20:50:08",product,clonex-root-maximizer-granular-for-soil-applications,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/clonex-root-maximizer-granular-for-soil-applications/,Hydrodynamics,,"Nutrients &amp; Supplements > Ionic Products",,grouped,visible,No,Domestic,No,"Clonex Mycorrhizae Root Maximizer 4 OZ Soluble|~|Clonex Mycorrhizae Root Maximizer 8 OZ Soluble|~|Clonex Mycorrhizae Root Maximizer 1 pound Soluble",,instock,no,no,,,"Thanks you for your order!",0,12,12,12,hmh01748,,,28.95||85,yes,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,large,,,,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RootMaxGroupGranular-scaled.jpg,RootMaxGroupGranular-scaled.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RootMaxGroupGranular-scaled.jpg,760,RootMaxGroupGranular,,,,,,,,,,,,1,nuwud,nuwud@nuwudmultimedia.com,Patrick,Wood,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,import-placeholder-for-1748-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2024-09-16 01:42:56"

SiLicium
SiLicium is beneficial for the regulation and the absorption of macro and micronutrients by the plant via xylem to the shoots and leaves. Silicon is translocated as anion, monosilicic acid, resulting as a silicon-cellulose membrane throughout the epidermal tissue. Found to have association with phosphorous and calcium ions, this process in which plant biomass enriches its level of silicon is called monosilicic acid polymerization.

The application of SiLicium through the root system results in increased resistance and protection against diseases, drought, heat and other environmental stressors during vegetative and budding development. Using SiLicium, your plants will root faster and develop stronger stems, leaves and plant biomass overall.","Dosage

Use a minimum of 15mL per 100 Liters OR .5ML per 1 gal of feeding water throughout the growing cycle.

ALWAYS mix SiLicium with Tap or RO water before any other nutrients.","2019-09-03 16:50:52",product,silicium-qts,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/silicium-qts/,,,"Nutrients &amp; Supplements > SiLICIUM",,simple,hidden,No,Domestic,No,,,instock,no,no,380,299,"Thanks you for your order!",10,8,6,4,hmh01763,,,299,no,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'-1,'-1,large,,,default,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Silicium-website-image.jpg,Silicium-website-image.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Silicium-website-image.jpg,784,"Silicium website image",,,,,,,,,,,,1,nuwud,nuwud@nuwudmultimedia.com,Patrick,Wood,,,,,,,,classic-editor,,0,,,no,,,,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043130552394"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665871605834"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,no,,import-placeholder-for-1763,60,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2025-04-08 17:30:44"

OZONE GENERATOR / Air Sanitation

A powerful oxidizer that removes odors by neutralizing them at the molecular level.

Ozone Generators work by pulling air into the generator and running it past an ultraviolet light, which converts the oxygen in the air into Ozone.

Ozone is highly reactive to most odor-causing contaminates and allergens, and when it encounters these pollutants it destroys them through oxidation

It eliminates odor, mold, bacteria, smoke, etc. Easy to use with no maintenance required.OZONE GENERATOR is for areas up to 5000 cubic ft. Sanitation

32121,"TEAMING WITH FUNGI The Organic Growers Guide to Mycorrhizae","TEAMING WITH FUNGI

The Organic Growers Guide to Mycorrhizae By Jeff Lowenfels

This book accomplishes what few other books have helping the public use these essential fungi to improve the immune systems of plants.

Paul Stamets, author of Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World

From the bestselling author of Teaming with Microbes and Teaming with Nutrients comes an important guide to mycorrhizae and the role they play in agriculture, horticulture, and hydroponics.

Teaming with Fungi is the first book to accessibly explain the essential symbiotic relationship between soil-dwelling mycorrhizal fungi and plants.

Almost every plant in a garden forms a relationship with fungi, and many plants would not exist without their fungal partners. By better understanding the relationship, gardeners can take advantage of the benefits of fungi, which include an increased uptake in nutrients, resistance to drought, earlier fruiting, and more.

Learn how the fungi interact with plants, how to grow their own, and how best to employ them in the home garden.",,"2019-11-14 14:24:04",product,teaming-with-fungi-the-organic-growers-guide-to-mycorrhizae,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/teaming-with-fungi-the-organic-growers-guide-to-mycorrhizae/,,,Books,,simple,visible,Yes,Domestic,No,,,instock,no,no,24.95,,,,,,,,,,24.95,no,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,large,,,,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/teaming-with-fungi.jpg-2017-print.jpg,teaming-with-fungi.jpg-2017-print.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/teaming-with-fungi.jpg-2017-print.jpg,31315,"teaming with fungi.jpg 2017 print",,,,,,,,,,,,5,yocina2,yocina2@gmail.com,michael,yocina,,,,,,,,,,0,,,no,,,,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043134812234"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665876947018"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,,,,30,,"TEAMING WITH FUNGI",42,,243,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2024-09-16 01:49:26"

Just as he demystified the soil food web in his ground-breaking book Teaming with Microbes
<ul>
 	<li>In this new work Jeff Lowenfels explains the basics of plant nutrition from an organic gardener's perspective.</li>
 	<li>Where Teaming with Microbes used adeptly used microbiology; Teaming with Nutrients employs cellular biology.</li>
 	<li>Most gardeners realize that plants need to be fed but know little or nothing about the nature of the nutrients involved or how they get into plants.</li>
 	<li>Teaming with Nutrients explains how nutrients move into plants and what both macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients do once inside. It shows organic gardeners how to provide these essentials. To fully understand how plants eat, Lowenfels uses his ability to make science accessible with lessons in the biology, chemistry, and botany all gardeners need to understand how nutrients get to the plant and what they do once they're inside the plant.</li>
 	<li>Teaming with Nutrients will open your eyes to the importance of understanding the role of nutrients in healthy, productive organic gardens and it will show you how these nutrients do their jobs. In short, it will make you a better informed, more successful and more environmentally responsible gardener.</li>

An Easy Way to Grow Your Own

by Jeff Lowenfels
Cannabis prohibition is ending around the world, and there’s a new bud in town — auto-flowering cannabis. As easy to grow as tomatoes, auto-flowering cannabis is the perfect new plant for the home gardener who has limited time and space.
Unlike commercially grown cannabis, auto-flowering cannabis plants are small, container-grown, day-neutral, require no special lights or equipment, and grow incredibly fast – from seed to harvest in as little as seven weeks.
Written by gardening authority Jeff Lowenfels, DIY Auto-flowering Cannabis is a full-color, illustrated guide for everyone wanting to grow their own. It covers:
The history and benefits of auto-flowering cannabis
Its origins, chemistry, and growing habits
Step-by-step growing methods, including tips, tricks, supplies, and seed sourcing
How to harvest, process, and breed your new plants.
If you are a home gardener or already grow cannabis, you too can learn how to
<ul>
 	<li>grow this new plant with ease, all while reaping its many benefits, such as</li>
 	<li>harvesting it for medical use, recreational use, or simply as a decorative, sweet-smelling flower to enjoy. If you like to grow tomatoes, you will love growing auto-flowering cannabis.</li>

<h2>Time for Improvement</h2>
For Decades growers have settled for lighting options that are not 100% tailored for their use and crop. Grow light manufacturers are always trying to appease the mass populations of growers, rather than honing in on exactly what they need for optimal performance, yields, and most important quality.

The engineering principles behind the DLI Open Reflector are a culmination of over a decade of research and development. The team works with a ranging group of some of the best horticulturists around the globe; each who specialise in plant and varietal specific production processes for the ornamental, and commercial flower market. Dutch Lighting Innovations has allowed these groups a new level of consistency, reliability, and quality unparalleled in the niche world of growing the best flowers and plants on Earth!

<hr />

<h2>How it works</h2>
The DLI reflectors are manufactured to have the highest possible total reflectance at all wavelengths from 400 to 700 nm giving excellent PAR rendition. The integrated hemispherical reflectance is over 95% with an absence of iridescence colours in the louvre.

The DLI reflectors are made from an electrochemically brightened high purity aluminium substrate coil, and start with an anodised base coat which gives a hard support to minimize abrasion damage. The material is then treated under vacuum with specially developed processes to maximise coating adhesion and is vacuum coated with a super pure reflection layer of 99.99% pure aluminium.

These reflection layers are overlaid with a dual layer oxide system tuned for maximum visible reflection enhancement. This serves to increase the overall reflectivity provided by the metallic layers and adds protection against damage.<img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-62528"" src=""https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DLI1000_l-200x79.jpg"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""79"" /><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-62529"" src=""https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/JOULE-SERIES-1000W-DE-dimmable-2-200x200.png"" alt="""" width=""200"" height=""200"" /></li>

62610,"DLI-DIODE-Series-LED Toplighting LED Fixture (Long)","DLI Toplighting fixtures are designed to deliver high levels of photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) values with optimal angled vertical light uniformity. The unique design of the lens creates a high uniform light distribution over the canopy.

The fixtures are constructed in a slim water-proof design and suspended above the plant canopy with the easy-hang system.
Toplighting fixture (long) Features
Extra Low-Profile Housing (Ideal for low ceilings)
Venturi effect (For optimal cooling)
High Output (Up to 1000 µmol/s)
IP65 Waterproof (Protected against water jets from any direction)
Time for Improvement
For Decades growers have settled for lighting options that are not 100% tailored for their use and crop. Grow light manufacturers are always trying to appease the mass populations of growers, rather than honing in on exactly what they need for optimal performance, yields, and most important quality.

The engineering principles behind the DLI Toplighting Fixtures are a culmination of over a decade of research and development. The team works with a ranging group of some of the best horticulturists around the globe; each who specialise in plant and varietal specific production processes for the ornamental, and commercial flower market. Dutch Lighting Innovations has allowed these groups a new level of consistency, reliability, and quality unparalleled in the niche world of growing the best flowers and plants on Earth!

For a uniform plant a uniform pattern is required
A percentage of harvestable plant height can suffer from lack of light due to dense canopy foliage; which will result in fewer flowers. Because of the unique light distribution the Toplighting system will provide High PAR PPF at an optimized coverage angle making sure the whole plant is activated by light.

Extensive trials have shown bigger leaves and flowers at the lower portions on the plant. The Toplighting fixtures emit very little heat and require no active cooling minimizing leaf burn.

The reason companies give out samples is to use growers as guinea pigs, because their products aren’t proven. Athena has been tested in facilities that have spent tens of millions of dollars on fertilizer. We’ve taken the risk so you don’t have to.

The status quo of nutrient companies is give out loads of samples, then make it up on selling over-priced products. We offer longer term value for money, rather than a short-term free sample.

Athena is about growing consistent high-grade cannabis at low cost per mixed gallon.

62645,"Athena Cleanse","Athena Cleanse is made from the ideal (and safe) root zone optimizing agents--Hypochlorous acid. This safe and mild acid is derived from salt and a proprietary electrochemical treatment process. The result is a unique, plant-safe chemical with powerful oxidative properties to keep your root zone clean and free of unwanted organic and mineral buildup.<span style=""font-size: large;""> </span>These special properties reduce mineral scale in irrigation systems.

<b> Key Features</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Non-toxic and non-nutritive - Safe to use on plants in and stage of growth</li>
 	<li>Works to descale irrigation systems and decompose residual organic matter</li>
 	<li>Effective as a final flush to remove mineral buildup (scale) in growing media and irrigation lines</li>
 	<li>Very low TDS - Doesn't throw off mineral balance</li>
 	<li>Effective as a final flush to clean growing media</li>
 	<li>Keeps irrigation system cleaner and running efficiently longer</li>
 	<li>Reduces mineral buildup in media and lines</li>
</ul>
How To Use

<b>System Maintenance:</b>
Irrigation systems that are regularly maintained with Athena Cleanse treatment will last longer, and run more optimally throughout. This is because Cleanse helps break down scale, mineral buildup, and other organic matter that has been lodged in the system.

<b>Regular Use:</b>
Use a dilute mixture of 2-5 mL per gallon water for regular maintenance.

<b>Severe Conditions:</b>
Increase rate to 5-10 mL per gallon water for combatting severe reservoir and growing media conditions.

<b>Cuttings/Clones:</b>
Athena Cleanse a must for all cloning machines and fresh cuttings. Dip fresh cuttings in a solution of Cleanse (10 mL per gallon) to improve cell health and increase immunity. Seedlings and cuttings treated with Cleanse have more vigor and are more likely to grow into robust plants. Roots of plants treated with Cleanse will be bright white and bursting with tiny feeder root hairs.

These special properties reduce mineral scale in irrigation systems and the growing media.

<b>RDWC and Other Recirculating Hydroponics Systems:</b>
Any recirculating or deep water culture (DWC) irrigation system should use Athena Cleanse remove mineral residue and reduce scale. Irrigation water treated with Cleanse has a reduced risk of developing problems that are often associated with overwatering and insufficient oxygen levels, such as anaerobic microbial growth and biofilm buildup.

Using Cleanse in a recirculating or DWC system helps break down materials with lower solubility ratings, such as mineral complexes that are no longer available to plants. Mineral buildup and lockout is a major cause of deficiencies and plant health problems-solve these issues with Athena Cleanse.

<b>Media/System Flush Mix:</b>
Athena Cleanse at a rate of 5-10 mL/ gallon of water during the final flush stage to help reduce residual mineral buildup in the growing media.

This procedure may be used at any time during vegetative or flowering phases if the growing media or irrigation system develops mineral imbalance or unwanted buildup.

<b>Foliar Applications:</b>
Mix 375 mL Cleanse per gallon water and spray evenly. Test on a small area first to ensure no damage.

<b>Surface Treatment/Cleaning:</b>
Spraying cultivation surfaces, work areas and irrigation equipment with a dilute solution of Athena Cleanse (375 mL per gallon) helps maintain a clean and trouble-free environment without toxic and dangerous chemicals. Maintain operational excellence and extend equipment life, such as irrigation system filters, by running treated water through the system regularly","[caption id=""attachment_62646"" align=""alignnone"" width=""200""]<img class=""size-medium wp-image-62646"" src=""https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LQ-CL_1-Gal_01-200x200.jpeg"" alt=""Athena Cleance"" width=""200"" height=""200"" /> Athena Cleanse is made from the ideal (and safe) root zone optimizing agents--Hypochlorous acid[/caption]","2021-12-11 15:50:46",product,athena-cleanse,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/athena-cleanse/,Athena,,"Nutrients &amp; Supplements > ATHENA",,simple,visible,No,Domestic,No,,,instock,no,no,70,,,,,,,,,,70,no,no,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,large,,,,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LQ-CL_1-Gal_01-1.jpeg||https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LQ-CL_1-Gal_01.jpeg,LQ-CL_1-Gal_01-1.jpeg||LQ-CL_1-Gal_01.jpeg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LQ-CL_1-Gal_01-1.jpeg||/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LQ-CL_1-Gal_01.jpeg,62657||62646,"LQ-CL_1 Gal_01||LQ-CLeance1 Gal","||Athena Cleanse is made from the ideal (and safe) root zone optimizing agents--Hypochlorous acid","oxic and non-nutritive - Safe to use on plants in and stage of growth

Commercial growers find better results, particularly with reverse osmosis (RO) water, when buffering first with Athena Balance. Pure RO water has unstable chemical structure that can trap other nutrients when added without a buffer. Athena Balance adds just enough to the water to create a more homogenous fertilizer solution and reduce the need to pH adjust after mixing.

Formula is sediment-free and is compatible with mechanical dosing systems (Dosatron).

In Teaming with Nutrients, he explored how those organisms aid in the uptake of nutrients. And in Teaming with Fungi, he detailed the symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi—the most important organism living in the soil.
 
In his new book Teaming with Bacteria, Lowenfels digs into the new science behind how endophytic bacteria supply nutrients to a large array of plants and explains, in accessible language, how this information applies to home gardeners, small-scale farmers, and cannabis growers. Based on cutting-edge science that will help gardeners increase plant health and productivity, Teaming with Bacteria is a must-have addition to every organic gardener’s library.","Jeff Lowenfels

It’s 8-20 times more effective than root feeding. Foliar Feeding is not just a quick fix for deficiencies. Provide additional nutrients to increase yield and quality. Micronutrients, calcium and supplemental fertilizer are often applied to plants through foliar feeding. With most plants, foliar feeding augments- not replaces- a standard root feeding program.

Foliar feeding is easy. Nutrients and a sprayer are all the equipment needed.","2023-02-10 12:47:18",product,spray-n-grow-micronutrients-8-oz,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/spray-n-grow-micronutrients-8-oz/,,,"Nutrients &amp; Supplements > Spray N Grow","Micronutrients are not in hydroponic solutions.

Foliar feeding provides nutrients to plants through its leaves and stems, not its root. Nutrients are sprayed on the leaves and stems and are absorbed by stomata, the epidermis and bark of woody plants. The nutrients move from the place of absorption throughout the entire plant, including the roots, within one day.

The fixture can be used in combination with both HPS and/or LED and serves as a supplement to the standard grow light. The wide, UV resistance reflector makes the fixture suitable for multiple lay-outs. UV lights work best, when they are on for at least 2 to 4 hours a day during the lighting cycle. The fixture can be used with our DLI controllers and therefore can be integrated with all existing DLI installations.

DLI exclusive
This fixture is one of a kind. Dutch Lighting Innovations is the only grow light manufacturer that develops and builds UV-light fixtures able to recreate all the UV-A and UV-B advantages inside. All advantages of outside sunlight, in a controlled environment.

Healthier plants and pest-control
There are specific photoreceptors for UV-B and UV-A that plants use to sense and learn about the environment around them and to regulate internal proceses based on this information. UV exposure at the right dose manifests in healthier, more resilient plants. Stimulation with UV light increases leaf and cell wall thickness and makes plants less susceptible to bugs and mould. This characteristic of UV light lowers the need for insecticides and fungicides and can also assist in the breakdown of residues that remain on surfaces.","Healthier plants and pest-control

DESCRIPTION
Dutch Lighting Innovations APEX-Series LED Toplight 800 FS-DC, 208-400V
Broad light spectrum and unique light distribution
The APEX-Series LED Toplight 800 FS-DC is a high-performance LED fixture designed for large greenhouse illumination. The broad light spectrum makes the fixture ideal for growing crops in rooms with little or no direct sunlight. To still provide the crops with the necessary light color spectrum and to maintain high efficiency, we make exclusive use of the latest generation of OSRAM LEDs. The innovative optical lens ensures high light uniformity, at every possible height and excellent light distribution.
unsurpassed Cooling
Dutch Lighting Innovations have developed a patented cooling technology that ensures the optimum reliability and longevity of our systems. Due to the unique positioning of the LED bars in the fixture, we create a Venturi effect. Our cooling method is unique, no one can cool fixtures like we do.

Compatible with All existing DLI systems
The Apex-Series LED toplight 800 FS-DC is a high-output, flicker-free fixture that can be used in single or multiple lights. It is fully compatible with all other products in our portfolio. It communicates seamlessly with the DLI controller and allows you to easily replace or extend your existing installation with this new fixture.","Unique cooling method
Reliable and a longer lifespan
The Venturi effect – reached by the unique position of the LED bars – ensures optimum passive cooling off the lights (cold air flows upwards, cools the LED bars and warmed-up air goes further upwards.). This method gives you direct advantages since the temperature of the LED heavily influences the lifespan and reliability of the fixtures. Thanks to our unique cooling system, we can therefore guarantee the best reliability and long lifespan. No other fixtures use this unique DLI-method!

63276,"Centurion Pro Tabletop Trimming Machine Wet or Dry","The Centurion Tabletop Pro is the smallest most efficient tumble
style trimmer in the world. This machines sits at a trim 24’’ in length X 10’’ width and 21’’ in height. Weighing only 35 lbs, this trimmer is the epitome of elegant engineering at its finest. Built for the connoisseur who admires the finer things in life, this machine was designed to be the most delicate machine on the market today.
Don’t be fooled by the size, the Tabletop Pro replaces over 6 human trimmers without sacrific-ing quality. This trimmer is currently being shipped World Wide to small growers who demand quality, durability, and privacy. This machine works with dry flowers and will harvest 3-4 lbs dry per hour of use. The Tabletop Pro runs completely off 120v power and comes with a strong 1hp leaf collector with 1800 CFM of suction power.
Another quality of the Tabletop Pro is ease of keeping the blade clean, which is made out of D2 hardened steel. Unlike any other brand on the market, The Centurion Tabletop Pro employs a magnetic blade holding technology that allows for a five minute clean-up during operation, ensur-ing the machine has a consistently sharp, clean cut, and operates at a rapid pace.
The Centurion brand is the only machines in the world that come inclusive with a non-stick QuanTanium Coated tumbler. The non-stick properties of the QuanTanium tumbler prevent precious trichomes from adhering to the tumbler surface. This results in the flowers having a better visual appearance while maintaining their strong natural aroma and flavours. Overall, you will notice a more potent flower as all natural properties are preserved during the harvesting process.
The extra large hopper makes consistent feeding of the machine easier.
Centurion machines are the only brand that uses a unique diverter to help fine tune the flow and cut on different strains giving the grower the ability to quickly adjust to different strains, or density of flowers. These diverters are how the machine can process dry flowers so delicately while still ensuring a tight clean cut and finish!

63370,"SiLICIUM Bloom, liter","SiLicium is beneficial for the regulation and the absorption of macro and micronutrients by the plant via xylem to the shoots and leaves. Silicon is translocated as anion, monosilicic acid, resulting as a silicon-cellulose membrane throughout the epidermal tissue. Found to have association with phosphorous and calcium ions, this process in which plant biomass enriches its level of silicon is called monosilicic acid polymerization. The application of SiLicium through the root system results in increased resistance and protection against diseases, drought, heat and other environmental stressors during vegetative and budding development. Using SiLicium, your plants will root faster and develop stronger stems, leaves and plant biomass overall.","SiLICIUM Bloom

During 12/12 flower cycles, switch to SiLICIUM Bloom in efforts to promote larger flowers and fruits as well as regulate “salt stress” caused from excess K/Na molecules. The ancillary effect of monosilicic acid and fulvic agents encourage the facilitation of phosphorous and calcium, but also simultaneously reduce toxicity of heavy metals, aluminum, and manganese within the plant system. Formulated specifically for budding and fruiting cycles, SiLICIUM Bloom provides silicon in the conjunctional form serving as a biological chelate.

SiLICIUM mono-silicic acid also ensures that the plant stomata diameter is decreased, which helps regulates moisture loss thereby enhancing the mobility of various macro and micro nutritional elements throughout the crop.

Increased resistance and protection against diseases.
Protection against diseases, drought, heat and other environmental stressors during vegetative and budding development.
SiLICIUM mono-silicic acid also ensures that the plant stomata diameter is decreased.

63448,"GOLD LABEL * HYBRID","GOLD LABEL * HYBRID
Hybrid Building Blocks

The Gold Label is the foundation of the GREASE™ line designed specifically to increase potency and terpenes. Hybrid plants respond to the Gold, elevating stickiness and aromas and presenting their uniqueness. It acts as a soil conditioner and is bioavailable through the roots or via spray. You need to see it and spray it to believe it! ""This stuff works"" is the sentiment shared by all users.

Grease Gold Label bridges the gap and harnesses the building blocks of Hybrids resins back on the Hybrid plant itself. All Grease Label products work to increase resin, but when you align the source material with the target crop, the efficiency goes up resulting in the maximum yield of unique and targeted compounds.

Hybrid varieties are created through the intentional breeding of different canna strains, resulting in offspring that possess a combination of the traits from their parent plants. The goal of hybridization is to produce offspring with desirable characteristics such as specific flavors, aromas, canna profiles, growth patterns, and effects.

There are two main types of hybrids: F1 hybrids and polyhybrids.

F1 Hybrids: F1 hybrids, also known as first-generation hybrids, are created by crossing two different strains with distinct characteristics. The resulting offspring exhibit a combination of traits from both parent strains. F1 hybrids are often highly sought after due to their genetic stability and uniformity, as the offspring from the cross tend to display consistent traits.
Polyhybrids: Polyhybrids refer to plants that are the result of multiple generations of hybridization. In polyhybrids, breeders select and cross multiple strains, creating complex genetic lineages with diverse characteristics. Polyhybrids offer a wider range of traits, including variations in flavor, aroma, potency, and growth patterns. These variations can result in a more diverse and unique experience.
Polyhybrids are favored by breeders and growers who seek to develop new and distinct cultivars. By carefully selecting and crossing multiple strains, breeders can create offspring that exhibit a wide array of desirable traits, catering to different preferences and market demands.

This is a beneficial substance to plants.

The Green Label is a gem for the industrial production of the plant. It is harnessing the principles of biomimicry at its finest. Spray GREASE™ Green Label in veg and especially in flower. It is amazing to have a safe alternative to spray in flower that will not leave foreign oils or residues of any kind. All GREASE™ products are free from pesticide residuals, heavy metals or residual solvents. We recommend drenching as well, as it is a proven soil conditioner.

All Grease Label products work to increase resin, but when you align the source material with the target crop, the efficiency goes up resulting in the maximum yield of unique and targeted compounds.

A natural plant wash, also known as a plant-based wash or organic wash, is an alternative to traditional chemical pesticides and can be used to remove dust and debris from the plants prior to harvesting. This is a first of its kind, new to the industry technology. Here are some benefits of using a natural Canna plant wash:

Pesticide-Free: Natural plant washes are made from botanical extracts and essential oils derived from plants. They do not contain synthetic chemicals or harmful pesticides, making them a safer and more environmentally friendly option for cultivation of the plant.
Residue Removal: Plants can accumulate dust, dirt, and other debris on their leaves and buds during the growing process. A natural plant wash helps remove these residues effectively, leaving the plants clean and free from contaminants. This can improve the appearance, quality, and overall cleanliness of the harvested buds.
Insect Control: Some natural plant washes contain ingredients with natural insecticidal properties. These ingredients can help deter pests and reduce the likelihood of insect infestations on the plants. While they may not eliminate all pests, they can provide an additional layer of protection without the use of synthetic pesticides.
Gentle and Non-Toxic: Natural plant washes are typically gentle on plants and do not cause harm or toxicity when used as directed. They are formulated to be safe for the plant's foliage and can be used throughout the flowering stage without adversely affecting the buds' development or taste.
Environmental Sustainability: By choosing a natural plant wash, you contribute to a more sustainable approach to cultivation of the plant. These products are often biodegradable and have minimal impact on soil, water, and surrounding ecosystems. They offer an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides that can have negative environmental consequences.
It's important to note that while natural plant washes can be beneficial for removing dust, debris, and pests, they are not a substitute for proper cultivation practices, including good hygiene, proper airflow, and pest prevention measures.

The final growth phase of cannabis during the last two weeks before harvest is a critical period known as the ""flushing"" or ""ripening"" phase. This phase is characterized by specific practices aimed at enhancing the final quality of the buds. Here are some key aspects of the final growth phase:

Nutrient Reduction: During the final growth phase, it's common to reduce or completely stop the use of nutrient supplements. This gradual reduction ensures that the plant's nutrient uptake decreases, which can help prevent excess nutrients from remaining in the buds and affecting the taste and quality.
Trichome Development: Trichomes are tiny resin glands that develop on the surface of the buds, leaves, and stems of the cannabis plant. These trichomes contain cannabinoids, terpenes, and other compounds that contribute to the potency and aroma of the final product. During the last two weeks, the trichomes reach their peak development, indicating the ideal time for harvest. You can monitor the trichomes using a magnifying tool and harvest when they appear milky or amber in color.
Ripening Signs: As the plant nears maturity, you may observe certain ripening signs. The pistils, the hair-like structures on the buds, may change color from white to orange, brown, or red. The buds may become denser, and the leaves may start to yellow and wither. These are natural signs of the plant's final growth phase.
Proper Environmental Conditions: During the last two weeks, it's crucial to maintain appropriate environmental conditions. Maintain the proper temperature and humidity levels to prevent mold or bud rot. Adequate airflow and ventilation are also important to minimize the risk of any moisture-related issues.
Flushing: Flushing refers to the practice of watering plants with plain water, without any nutrients or additives. The purpose of flushing is to remove any residual nutrients or chemical buildup from the plant's tissues. By flushing, you allow the plant to consume its stored nutrients, resulting in a cleaner and smoother smoke.

63471,"Blue Grease * Algae Extract","Algae Extract - Antioxidant
Targeted naturally occurring antioxidant for plants. Blue Grease contains the highest quality phycocyanin naturally derived from blue-green algae

One of the only naturally occurring blue pigments on Earth, derived from blue-green algae. Blue Grease is a premium extract known as phycocyanin, which works as an antioxidant within the plant, and is a critical accessory pigment for chlorophyll which runs photosynthesis in the plant. 

Light-Harvesting Apparatus: In photosynthetic organisms like blue-green algae, phycocyanin serves as a light-harvesting apparatus. It captures light energy and transfers it to chlorophyll, which is involved in the process of photosynthesis. By absorbing light in the blue and red regions of the spectrum, phycocyanin maximizes the energy available for photosynthesis, promoting the growth and survival of these organisms.

Rich in nutrients: Algae is a natural source of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and trace elements like zinc, iron, and copper. These nutrients are vital for plant growth and play a crucial role in supporting various physiological processes.
Growth-promoting hormones: Algae contains natural growth hormones like auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, which stimulate cell division, root development, and overall plant growth. These hormones help plants adapt to stress, enhance root systems, and encourage healthy foliage growth.
Enhanced root development: The growth hormones present in algae contribute to robust root development. Strong and healthy root systems improve nutrient and water uptake, making plants more resilient to environmental stressors.
Improved stress tolerance: The organic compounds and minerals in algae help plants build resistance against environmental stress, such as drought, heat, and cold. It aids in improving plant health and vitality, even under challenging conditions.
Increased plant metabolism: Algae extracts encourage enhanced metabolic activities within plants, leading to improved photosynthesis and nutrient assimilation. This can result in healthier and more vigorous plant growth.
Disease and pest resistance: The nutrients and bioactive compounds in algae help bolster a plant's natural defense mechanisms, making them more resistant to diseases and pests.
Better nutrient uptake: Algae contains natural chelating agents that facilitate the uptake of essential nutrients from the soil, making them more available to the plants. This improves overall nutrient utilization efficiency.

With photosynthesis being the main driver of ALL plant processes, it is very important to keep photosynthesis support.  This consistency of energy supporting your plant leads to the maximization of all the vital systems including overall yield, resin production, terpenes, plant defense, and nutritional benefits. Most importantly it does this quickly, and with a short term plant with a narrow window of growth this is critical. 

Our studies show accelerated growth and enhanced energy uptake by the plant when using Blue Grease. Some plants may even take on a darker green pigmentation in veg and more easily produce purples and blues in flower. 

Reactive oxygen and other compounds may cause continuous stress within the plant. All of the main abiotic and biotic stress factors such as heat, cold, damage, and UV ends up being oxidative stress due to the plants ability to cope with these factors.

63474,"OG Grease * Trace Booster","OCEAN GROWN MINERALS - TRACE BOOSTER
Seawater Extract = Flavor

Unique ocean grown trace minerals to maximize aromas. OG Grease contains the most complete trace minerals content from a unique single source. The use of seawater for plant growth has been practiced for centuries.This agricultural technique, known as ""seawater irrigation"" or ""saltwater irrigation,"" involves using diluted seawater as a natural fertilizer and soil amendment. The practice has shown several benefits, and a similar phenomenon was observed in Sri Lanka after the fields were flooded with ocean water from the tsunami.

Mineral Enrichment: Seawater is rich in minerals and trace elements, including potassium, magnesium, and various micronutrients. When diluted and applied to agricultural fields, these minerals can replenish soil fertility and provide essential nutrients for plant growth. This is especially beneficial for crops grown in soil that may be deficient in certain minerals.
Salt Tolerance: Some plants, particularly certain varieties of rice and salt-tolerant crops, have adapted to grow in saline conditions. By using diluted seawater, these crops can utilize the nutrients present in seawater while tolerating the salinity. This enables farmers in coastal areas to cultivate crops in soil that may otherwise be unsuitable for conventional agriculture.
Pest and Disease Control: Excellent alternative to pesticides, fungicides, and insecticides. Seawater contains natural substances that may help control certain pests and diseases, reducing the need for chemical pesticides and fungicides. This aligns with the principles of sustainable and organic agriculture. Excellent addition to an Integrated Pest Management routine. 
Soil Improvement: Seawater irrigation can help improve soil structure and increase its water-holding capacity. The minerals in seawater can aid in soil aggregation, enhancing soil fertility and moisture retention. This can be particularly advantageous in regions with sandy or infertile soils, where water and nutrient retention are crucial for successful crop growth.",,"2024-03-24 15:15:06",product,og-grease-trace-booster,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/og-grease-trace-booster/,GREASE™,,Grease,,simple,visible,No,Domestic,No,,,instock,no,no,19.97,,,8.45351,,,,,,,19.97,no,yes,100,,,,,,0,0,,,no,taxable,,0,,,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,large,,,,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":"""",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OGGreasecopy-1-scaled.webp,OGGreasecopy-1-scaled.webp,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/OGGreasecopy-1-scaled.webp,63475,"OGGreasecopy (1)",,,,,,,,,,,,1648,pwood,nuwudorder@gmail.com,Patrick,Wood,,,,,,,,classic-editor,,0,,,no,,no,bottom,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043122884682"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665863970890"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,no,,,60,1,,,,668,669,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2024-09-16 01:50:21"
63476,"Golden Gun * Nano Sulfur","<h2><strong>NANO SULFUR - TERPENE BOOSTER</strong></h2>
<p style=""font-weight: 400;"">Harness the elemental power of sulfur to increase terpenes. Grease Golden Gun uses the power of sulfur to amp up terpene levels. Drench consistently for flavor. Knock the rust off with the golden bullet. Sulfur is an essential plant nutrient that plays a vital role in various biochemical processes within plants. It is involved in the synthesis of proteins, enzymes, vitamins, and other important compounds. When it comes to terpene production, sulfur availability can have a significant impact.</p>

<ol>
 	<li><strong>Precursor for Terpene Synthesis:</strong> Terpenes are a diverse group of compounds responsible for the characteristic aromas and flavors of plants. They are derived from isoprene units, which are built from the basic precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Sulfur is required for the synthesis of IPP and its conversion into other terpene compounds. Adequate sulfur availability ensures a sufficient supply of IPP, which can lead to increased terpene production.</li>
 	<li><strong>Activation of Enzymes:</strong> Sulfur is involved in the activation of enzymes responsible for terpene biosynthesis. It helps in the formation and activity of key enzymes, such as terpene synthases, which catalyze the conversion of IPP into specific terpene compounds. Sulfur acts as a cofactor for these enzymes, enabling them to function optimally and enhance terpene production.</li>
 	<li><strong>Regulation of Gene Expression:</strong> Sulfur can influence the expression of genes involved in terpene biosynthesis. It acts as a signaling molecule, triggering the upregulation of genes responsible for terpene production. Sulfur deficiency can lead to downregulation of these genes, resulting in reduced terpene synthesis. By ensuring an adequate supply of sulfur, the expression of terpene-related genes can be enhanced, leading to increased terpene levels.</li>
 	<li><strong>Enhanced Secondary Metabolism:</strong> Sulfur availability influences the overall metabolism of plants, including secondary metabolites like terpenes. Adequate sulfur levels promote an optimal balance of primary and secondary metabolism, ensuring that resources are allocated towards terpene synthesis. Sulfur deficiency can disrupt this balance and redirect resources towards other metabolic pathways, potentially leading to decreased terpene production.</li>
 	<li><strong>Defense Mechanisms:</strong> Terpenes play a crucial role in plant defense against herbivores, pathogens, and environmental stresses. They can act as natural repellents, toxins, or antimicrobial agents. Sulfur availability can influence the production of terpenes involved in plant defense mechanisms, enabling plants to respond more effectively to stressors and threats. By providing sufficient sulfur, plants can enhance their ability to produce terpenes with defensive properties.</li>
 	<li><strong>Plant Nutrition:</strong> Sulfur is an essential nutrient for plant growth and development. It plays a vital role in the synthesis of proteins, enzymes, and chlorophyll, contributing to overall plant vigor and vitality. Sulfur provides a supplementary source of sulfur to plants, ensuring they have an adequate supply of this essential nutrient. Sulfur deficiency can lead to stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced crop yields.</li>
 	<li><strong>pH Adjustment:</strong> Sulfur can help regulate soil pH levels. It is commonly used to lower soil pH in alkaline soils, making them more acidic and creating a favorable environment for plants that prefer slightly acidic conditions. By adjusting the soil pH, Sulfur can improve nutrient availability and uptake by plants, enhancing their overall health and growth.</li>
 	<li><strong>Environmentally Friendly:</strong> It is a naturally occurring substance and does not persist in the environment or pose significant risks to humans, animals, or beneficial insects when used correctly. It offers an alternative to synthetic pesticides and chemical treatments, promoting sustainable and organic farming practices.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li>It's important to note that while sulfur is essential for terpene production, other factors such as genetics, environmental conditions, and overall plant health also play a role in terpene levels. Additionally, the specific effects of sulfur on terpene production may vary depending on the plant species and the specific terpene compounds involved. Optimal sulfur fertilization practices should be determined based on plant requirements, soil conditions, and local recommendations.</li>

A set of wholly original under-trays designed for use with fabric pots to automatically deliver water to eliminate the need for active irrigation. The patented self-watering fabric pot base (US Patent #11877546) directs water up to your plant using high absorption wick lines that moisten the soil and roots. Its heavy-duty saucer stores runoff water and nutrients and, when used with the reservoir plate, can withstand up to 100 pounds. This plate elevates your fabric pot up off the ground to keep algae and other buildups from spreading. A water gauge is included to display water levels in the reservoir while the strainer spout on the other end enables quick pouring and replenishing.
pack set can support round fabric pots with up to 5-gallon capacities, weighing up to 100 pounds. You can set this anywhere traditional saucer trays and potted planters are found including spaces like:

63833,"microBIOMETER® 10 Test Starter Kit","microBIOMETER®
is a 20-minute on-site soil test to determine microbial biomass and fungal to bacterial ratio. This lab grade soil test is simple to perform with rapid results. It’s faster, less expensive and more accurate than sending your soil to labs because microbes start dying once they are removed from the earth.
Soil microbes secrete a substance that binds non-living soil particles to each other and to themselves. Our patented method extracts the microbes from the bound soil particles which then settle to the bottom. The soil-colored microbes remain suspended in the fluid and are sampled. The sample is placed on a testcard which is scanned using a smartphone (iPhone or Android). Our smartphone application measures the color intensity of the microbes as compared to a color comparator surround on the testcard. Microbial biomass results are reported as µg of microbial carbon per gram of soil and fungal to bacterial ratio as F:B, F% and B%. Download and print instructions here – Soil and Compost Testing and Compost Tea and Extract Testing or watch our video tutorial here.
The results were validated using a computerized analysis of numerous microscopic images of microBIOMETER® extracts from many different soils. We found a 95% correlation with the area of the microbes in these images and the results reported for microbial biomass and fungal to bacterial ratios using microBIOMETER®.

We have collected and analyzed hundreds of microBIOMETER® testing results as well as worked with customers to create a chart of microbial biomass ranges that can be used as a guide to help you better understand your data. This chart will enable you to see where your results fall in relation to others using our test on similar media. Also included is a plant succession ladder which highlights optimal fungal to bacterial ratios for different vegetation.
The higher the microbial biomass, the more nutrients available to your plant naturally, decreasing or eliminating the need for chemical fertilizers.
Microbes, especially fungi, are building soil structure which prevents erosion.
If microbial biomass decreases after applying chemical fertilizer, you have used too much.
Determining the F:B ratio in the soil of the rhizome will tell you if arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have colonized your plant making it more resistant to drought and pests.
An increase in the F:B ratio indicates the green manure you used is optimal.
Soil organic carbon is mainly the bodies of dead microbes, so if you are not increasing your microbes you are not building soil health or sequestering carbon.
A rapid increase in MB indicates the effectiveness of cover crops and amendments.

63866,"SiLICIUM mono si 250 ml","SiLICIUM is beneficial for the regulation and the absorption of macro and micronutrients by the plant via xylem to the shoots and leaves. Silicon is translocated as anion, monosilicic acid, resulting as a silicon-cellulose membrane throughout the epidermal tissue. Found to have association with phosphorous and calcium ions, this process in which plant biomass enriches its level of silicon is called monosilicic acid polymerization.

The application of SiLICIUM through the root system results in increased resistance and protection against diseases, drought, heat and other environmental stressors during vegetative and budding development. Using SiLicium, your plants will root faster and develop stronger stems, leaves and plant biomass overall.

Silicon Rich structure increases the transport of calcium, phosphorus and other essential elements.
Tighter node stacking results in more flowering sites.
Accelerated growth rates occur from enhanced cellular structure within the plant.

63867,"SiLICIUM mono si 500 ml","Key Information
SiLicium facilitates the absorption and regulation of macro and micronutrients within plants through xylem, enhancing their growth and development. It strengthens stems, leaves, and overall biomass, while also increasing resistance to diseases, drought, heat, and environmental stresses during vegetative and budding stages.
The application of SiLicium through the root system results in robust plant growth, with faster root development and stronger stems and leaves. This silicon-rich structure facilitates the transport of essential elements such as calcium and phosphorus, leading to tighter node stacking and increased flowering sites. Accelerated growth rates are achieved through enhanced cellular structures within the plant.
For optimal results, it is recommended to use a dosage of at least 15mL per 100 Liters or 0.5mL per 1 gallon of feeding water throughout the entire growing cycle. It is crucial to mix SiLicium with tap or RO water before adding any other nutrients to ensure proper integration and effectiveness.

While designed to significantly reduce the need for additional feeding, it supports organic or salt-based feeding regimens.

After the tragic loss of Franco Loja beginning of 2017 the world has been waiting for a strain dedicated to Franco.

The strain that would represent Franco the best could only be his very last cross of two of his favourite plants: The multiple cup winning Super Lemon Haze and the famous Exodus Cheese.

Green House Seed Co is donating profits from the sales of Franco’s Lemon Cheese to the Franco Loja fund which will help finance his children’s education.

We selected the Banana Punch for its smell and flavor of overripe bananas and cinnamon and crossed it with our selected OG Kush to bring back the gassy fuel like flavor.

Banana Krumble grows very short with thick, overlapping fingers and only starts to stretch in late veg and early flower. It can take moderate to high feedings and produces medium high yields. The compact buds will need support during the last weeks of flowering.

Buds are dense and covered in resin, making it an ideal strain for extraction",,"2025-07-24 16:44:28",product,banana-krumble-feminised-banana-punch-x-og-kush-5-seed,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/banana-krumble-feminised-banana-punch-x-og-kush-5-seed/,"Cannabis Seed","GreenHouse Seed","Cannabis Seeds","GREENHOUSE SEED",simple,visible,No,,No,,,instock,no,no,50,,,.25,3,4,.25,,,,50,no,no,,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,no,none,zero-rate,0,,,0,0,,,0,"{""focus"":{""keyphrase"":"""",""score"":0,""analysis"":{""keyphraseInTitle"":{""score"":0,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1}}},""additional"":[]}","{""analysis"":{""basic"":{""metadescriptionLength"":[],""lengthContent"":{""score"":-10,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isInternalLink"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isExternalLink"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""errors"":2},""title"":{""titleLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":1},""readability"":{""contentHasAssets"":{""error"":1,""score"":1,""maxScore"":5},""paragraphLength"":{""score"":5,""maxScore"":5,""error"":0},""sentenceLength"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""passiveVoice"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""transitionWords"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""consecutiveSentences"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""subheadingsDistribution"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""calculateFleschReading"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":3}}}",69,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'-1,'-1,large,,,default,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":""ItemPage"",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BananaKrumble.jpg,BananaKrumble.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BananaKrumble.jpg,64031,BananaKrumble,,,,,,,,,,,,5,yocina2,yocina2@gmail.com,michael,yocina,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,,no,bottom,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043100995658"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665841033290"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2025-07-24 16:44:30"

The AlienZ auto is a mix of our AlienZ, with it’s incredible sweetness and sourness, crossed with the Watermelon autoflowering genetic.

The AlienZ auto grows with the strong vigor of the AlienZ, in a beautiful typical christmas tree shape with long and strong secondary branches. The branches will fill up of flower site with medium internoedal length, and later form long and wide colas by the end of flowering. The AlienZ auto inherited the amazing amount of sticky resin from the WatermelonZ and Velvet Moon combined, making it a great candidate for extractions with a great flower yield and a pungent smell.

&nbsp;

Wonder Pie is a cross of the popular Wedding Cake with our selected OG Kush.

The flavor goes from fruity, sweet to gassy making it an allround strain. The influences of Triangle Kush and Cookie ancestor are dominant while the OG Kush flavor comes through on the exhale.

The plant grows tall and will double in size during the flowering period and should be topped and trained to maximize yield.

The buds are long, very dense and covered in trichomes.",,"2025-07-24 17:07:40",product,4of32-wonder-pie-feminised-wedding-cake-x-og-kush-5-seed,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/4of32-wonder-pie-feminised-wedding-cake-x-og-kush-5-seed/,"Cannabis Seed",,"Cannabis Seeds","GREENHOUSE SEED",simple,visible,No,,No,,,instock,no,no,50,,,.25,3,4,.25,,,,50,no,no,,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,no,none,zero-rate,0,,,0,0,,,0,"{""focus"":{""keyphrase"":"""",""score"":0,""analysis"":{""keyphraseInTitle"":{""score"":0,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1}}},""additional"":[]}","{""analysis"":{""basic"":{""metadescriptionLength"":[],""lengthContent"":{""score"":-10,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isInternalLink"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isExternalLink"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""errors"":2},""title"":{""titleLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":1},""readability"":{""contentHasAssets"":{""error"":1,""score"":1,""maxScore"":5},""paragraphLength"":{""score"":5,""maxScore"":5,""error"":0},""sentenceLength"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""passiveVoice"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""transitionWords"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""consecutiveSentences"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""subheadingsDistribution"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""calculateFleschReading"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""errors"":2}}}",72,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'-1,'-1,large,,,default,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":""ItemPage"",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GHSC_WonderPie_.jpg,GHSC_WonderPie_.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GHSC_WonderPie_.jpg,64038,GHSC_WonderPie_,,,,,,,,,,,,5,yocina2,yocina2@gmail.com,michael,yocina,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,,no,bottom,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043135533130"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665877635146"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2025-07-25 11:20:24"

The Jack’s dream is a cross of two of our classics from Green House Seeds catalogue, the Jack Herer and its amazing piney, hazey terpene profile and frosty flowers, and the AMS our most resistant strain to fungus/mold, but also one of the sweetest strain with some earthy background on the exhale.

The combination of the two parents produced an amazing compact plant with a beautiful steady structure full of branches, short internoedal length, perfect for spaces with little roof space, and some dense flowers covered in trichomes.

The smell of the flowers is a perfect mix of the pine tree sap and pepper notes from the Jack Herer with an earthiness and sweetness from the AMS balancing the piney terpenes, a great combination.",,"2025-07-24 17:21:30",product,jacks-dream-feminised-jack-herer-x-a-m-s-5-seed,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/jacks-dream-feminised-jack-herer-x-a-m-s-5-seed/,"Cannabis Seed",,"Cannabis Seeds","GREENHOUSE SEED",simple,visible,No,,No,,,instock,no,no,50,,,.25,3,4,.25,,,,50,no,no,,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,no,none,zero-rate,0,,,0,0,,,0,"{""focus"":{""keyphrase"":"""",""score"":0,""analysis"":{""keyphraseInTitle"":{""score"":0,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1}}},""additional"":[]}","{""analysis"":{""basic"":{""metadescriptionLength"":[],""lengthContent"":{""score"":-10,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isInternalLink"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isExternalLink"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""errors"":2},""title"":{""titleLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":1},""readability"":{""contentHasAssets"":{""error"":1,""score"":1,""maxScore"":5},""paragraphLength"":{""score"":5,""maxScore"":5,""error"":0},""sentenceLength"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""passiveVoice"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""transitionWords"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""consecutiveSentences"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""subheadingsDistribution"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""calculateFleschReading"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":3}}}",71,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'-1,'-1,large,,,default,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":""ItemPage"",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Jacks-Dream_.jpg,Jacks-Dream_.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Jacks-Dream_.jpg,64043,Jack&#8217;s-Dream_,,,,,,,,,,,,5,yocina2,yocina2@gmail.com,michael,yocina,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,,no,bottom,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043117117514"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665857941578"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2025-07-24 17:21:32"

The Sugarlato Auto is our latest expression of the Gelato in autoflowering form. We wanted to add some potency and an extra sweetness and creaminess, which we accomplished by crossing it with the King’s Tart.

The result is a beautiful plant that will not grow very tall, medium-sized but with beautiful broad and heavy flowers all over the branches.

The Sugarlato will grow in compact form with the secondary branches staying close to the main stem, but producing many flower sites with short internodal space, producing some beautiful long flowers that will connect together and will be covered in a glittery and sticky resin.

&nbsp;

The Skunk Autoflowering is an old-school Skunk crossed with a pure Ruderalis from Kazakstan.
The result is an outstandingly performing autoflowering, with extreme vigour and great production up to 80-100 grams of dried material per plant.
The structure of the Skunk Autoflowering is branchy, withmedium to large internodes.
It is a medium-tall autoflowering, and it performs best when the plantsare allowed to reach 90-120 cm of height.
The Skunk Autoflowering stretches fast during the first two weeks of growth, developing strong branches and lush foliage.
The leaves are dark green, thick, with overlapping leaflets.
The Skunk Autoflowering is ready in 9 weeks total crop time, with a flowering time of approximately 7 weeks.
The aroma and flavor are very intense with a dominant earthy smell and a caramelized background.
All the intense notes present in the aroma are translating very well after combustion.
The Skunk Autoflowering can take high EC levels, up to 2.0 during flowering.
The plant is very robust, and does not suffer hot temperatures up to 30 degrees Celsius.
The buds are slow to form during the first weeks of flowering, but develop very rapidly during the last few weeks,
allowing growers to chose the ripeness of their harvest within a short time period at the end of the crop.
The effect is fast hitting, intense, with a cerebral high followed by a mellow but long-lasting bodystoned side.
The complexity of the effect is very similar to the original Skunk.
The medicinal effects of this strain are still to be evaluated.","2025-07-24 18:02:29",product,skunk-auto-feminised-skunk-x-ruderalis-5-seed,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/skunk-auto-feminised-skunk-x-ruderalis-5-seed/,"Cannabis Seed","GreenHouse Seed","Cannabis Seeds","GREENHOUSE SEED",simple,visible,No,,No,,,instock,no,no,40,,,.25,3,4,.25,,,,40,no,no,,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,no,none,zero-rate,0,,,0,0,,,0,"{""focus"":{""keyphrase"":"""",""score"":0,""analysis"":{""keyphraseInTitle"":{""score"":0,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1}}},""additional"":[]}","{""analysis"":{""basic"":{""metadescriptionLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""lengthContent"":{""score"":-10,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isInternalLink"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""isExternalLink"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""errors"":2},""title"":{""titleLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":1},""readability"":{""contentHasAssets"":{""error"":1,""score"":1,""maxScore"":5},""paragraphLength"":{""score"":5,""maxScore"":5,""error"":0},""sentenceLength"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""passiveVoice"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""transitionWords"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""consecutiveSentences"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""subheadingsDistribution"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""calculateFleschReading"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":3}}}",78,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'-1,'-1,large,,,default,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":""ItemPage"",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Skunk-Auto.jpg||https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OIP.webp,Skunk-Auto.jpg||OIP.webp,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Skunk-Auto.jpg||/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OIP.webp,64053||63977,"Skunk Auto||OIP",,,,,,,,,,,,5,yocina2,yocina2@gmail.com,michael,yocina,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,,no,bottom,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043132551242"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665874194506"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2025-07-24 18:02:31"

<span class=""product-title-indica"">DESCRIPTION</span></p>
&nbsp;

The Flowerbomb Kush is the winner of the 2012 High Times Cannabis Cup with the Green House Coffeeshop. It is a very smelly, very tasty kush, with a very stoned effect.
The Flowerbomb Kush grows stretchier than most kushes, with long branches that compete with the main cola. The leaves are thick, overlapping, and very dark green, with black hues.
The plants can be fed medium EC levels, and perform well in hydroponics, but in soil, the flavour and taste are even sweeter and fruitier.
The buds are irregular in shape, with extra-large calyxes forming tower,s and are prone to foxtail.
The buds get very compact and extremely dense.
The resin is extremely thick and extends to most of the leaves once the flowering is reaching the end. The Flowerbomb Kush is not the heaviest producer, but it gives a unique quality.
The first flavour is earthy, mossy, very much like an OG kush, but immediately after the explosion of fruits invades the palate. And it ends with a spicier side, almost edgy.

The ""Fullgas!"" is a tribute to our late beloved partner, Franco Loja. The people that knew Franco know that his favorite strain of all time was the Cheese, and particularly the Exodus Cheese.

This cross is very special to the Green House Seeds family, because this cut of Exodus Cheese was selected with Dust when Franco was still living in Barcelona around 2015 and it has a special meaning to us. To pair this incredible strain that is the Exodus Cheese, which is so complex in taste already, we wanted to add something vigorous. We believe the best match for this, with gassy notes, (which is what we thought the exodus lacked), is one of our latest selections from Sunset Sherbert x Diagonal OG by Cannarado Genetics.

The phenotype selected had that perfect bud shape and smell from the Diagonal OG but with the creaminess and sweetness of the Sunset, a perfect mix of both with a beautiful plant structure typical to the OG. The result came out as a stunning cross that combines the powerful and pungent smell of the Exodus Cheese with the plant structure and vigor of the Sherbert OG.",,"2025-07-24 18:42:24",product,fullgas-feminised-exodus-cheese-x-sherbert-og-photo-5-seed,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/fullgas-feminised-exodus-cheese-x-sherbert-og-photo-5-seed/,"Cannabis Seed","GreenHouse Seed","Cannabis Seeds","GREENHOUSE SEED",simple,visible,No,,No,,,instock,no,no,66.0,,,.25,3,4,.25,,,,66.0,no,no,,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,no,none,zero-rate,0,,,0,0,,,0,"{""focus"":{""keyphrase"":"""",""score"":0,""analysis"":{""keyphraseInTitle"":{""score"":0,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1}}},""additional"":[]}","{""analysis"":{""basic"":{""metadescriptionLength"":[],""lengthContent"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isInternalLink"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isExternalLink"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""errors"":2},""title"":{""titleLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":1},""readability"":{""contentHasAssets"":{""error"":1,""score"":1,""maxScore"":5},""paragraphLength"":{""score"":5,""maxScore"":5,""error"":0},""sentenceLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""passiveVoice"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""transitionWords"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""consecutiveSentences"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""subheadingsDistribution"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""calculateFleschReading"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""errors"":4}}}",66,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'-1,'-1,large,,,default,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":""ItemPage"",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GHSC_Fullgas__WEB.jpg.jpg||https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OIP.webp,GHSC_Fullgas__WEB.jpg.jpg||OIP.webp,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GHSC_Fullgas__WEB.jpg.jpg||/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OIP.webp,64002||63977,GHSC_Fullgas__WEB.jpg||OIP,,,,,,,,,,,,5,yocina2,yocina2@gmail.com,michael,yocina,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,,no,bottom,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043112235082"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665852993610"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2025-07-25 10:43:15"

<span class=""product-title-hybrid"">Description</span>
Super Lemon Haze x Pink Candy is the third in our new Super Lemon Haze breeding line, showcasing a unique profile of growth and flavor compared to its two sisters. There’s no need to introduce Super Lemon Haze—the queen of all lemon strains and a staple in our industry. This time, we combined it with Pink Candy, a cross of Pink Panties X Candy Kush, which produces one of the sweetest and most intense cotton candy aromas we've ever encountered. The beautiful blend of cotton candy notes, with a hint of Kush in the background, brings light earthy and mossy undertones, creating a stunning flavor profile.
The result is a beautiful and vigorous plant that grows long and tall secondary branches that can compete with the main stem and support compact flowers covered in a sticky and thick layer of trichomes. The shape of the flowers is a perfect mix of both parents, predominantly resembling the structure of Super Lemon Haze but with the compactness and resin production of Pink Candy, which also produces excellent hash.

<span class=""product-title-auto"">Product Info</span>
This beautiful strain is the result of a careful selection of Blue Haze, which was crossed with Gelato #41 Auto-flowering.

The result is a very fragrant plant that expresses both Haze and Gelato characters. The effects are well balanced and appreciated by all consumers. Flavors range from sour, lemony, sweet, and even gassy.

The plant is very nice and compact, and because of the haze genes, this plant tends to be slightly taller than the other crosses of Gelato #41 Auto. Indoors, this plant can produce up to 500g/m2 if grown correctly, with a height of 100/140 cm. Outdoors it is also very resistant and can produce up to 80/100g per plant.

This genetic is characterized by medium node spacing and good number of branches. The flowers are elongated and full of trichomes, with colors ranging from dark green to purple.",,"2025-07-25 12:00:24",product,blue-haze-x-gelato-41-auto-feminised-blue-haze-x-gelato-41-auto-5-seed,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/blue-haze-x-gelato-41-auto-feminised-blue-haze-x-gelato-41-auto-5-seed/,"Cannabis Seed","GreenHouse Seed","Cannabis Seeds","GREENHOUSE SEED",simple,visible,No,,No,,,instock,no,no,66,,,.25,3,4,.25,,,,66,no,no,,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,no,none,zero-rate,0,,,0,0,,,0,"{""focus"":{""keyphrase"":"""",""score"":0,""analysis"":{""keyphraseInTitle"":{""score"":0,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1}}},""additional"":[]}","{""analysis"":{""basic"":{""metadescriptionLength"":[],""lengthContent"":{""score"":-10,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isInternalLink"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""isExternalLink"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""errors"":1},""title"":{""titleLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":1},""readability"":{""contentHasAssets"":{""error"":1,""score"":1,""maxScore"":5},""paragraphLength"":{""score"":5,""maxScore"":5,""error"":0},""sentenceLength"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""passiveVoice"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""transitionWords"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""consecutiveSentences"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""subheadingsDistribution"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""calculateFleschReading"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""errors"":3}}}",80,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'-1,'-1,large,,,default,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":""ItemPage"",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Blue-Haze-Gelato.jpg||https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OIP.webp,Blue-Haze-Gelato.jpg||OIP.webp,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Blue-Haze-Gelato.jpg||/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OIP.webp,64070||63977,Blue-Haze-Gelato||OIP,,,,,,,,,,,,5,yocina2,yocina2@gmail.com,michael,yocina,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,,no,bottom,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043104141386"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665844310090"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2025-07-25 12:01:54"

<span class=""product-title-indica"">What the dried bud/crumbled bud looks like</span>
The dried buds small but very dense, with huge calyx clusters dripping with resin already after few weeks of flowering.
The crumbled bud is sticky, dark green, with black hues. Small, thin hairs.

<span class=""product-title-indica"">DESCRIPTION</span>
The Money Maker is a very old-school plant. A true Master Kush, High Times Cannabis Cup winner in the early 90s, presented in feminized form.
Short, bushy, with very small internodes, it grows very fast and has an extremely vigorous attitude.
The leaf shows some sativa heritage, but the buds are definitely full indica, with a berry-sweet aroma that turns rapidly into a very kushy, earthy feel.
The calyx is large, buds grow irregular in shape and tend to slight fox-tailing.
The Money Maker makes very compact, heavy flower clusters, and it has very low leaf-to-calyx ratio so manicuring is very easy.
The Money Maker can take high nutrients levels, and grows very well in soil, coco, hydroponic or aeroponic systems.
It performs well indoors and outdoors, and is ideal for beginners as well as for advanced growers.</p>

<span class=""product-title-hybrid"">Product info</span>

The King’s Juice is a combination of two of Arjan’s favorite terpene profiles. On one hand, our selected Mimosa from Symbiotic Genetics, which has those deep floral perfumes that the king loves so much, and on the other hand our famous King’s Kush, with its citrusy potency.

What came out is an outstanding plant with a beautiful coney/piney type of growth and a long main cola that will grow a bit higher than the sides and allow the secondary branches to make a beautiful crown around it.

The plants will have quite a stretch during flowering time—you can expect them at least to double in size during the first weeks of flowering, with steady branches and vigorous growth.

The flowers have an amazing smell that balances perfectly the floral of the Mimosa with the extra citrusy/earthy touch of the Kush ancestors, which gives us an amazingly complex fragrance that resembles some kind of fresh fruit juice, alongside some beautiful colors at the end of flowering, most of the plants will take some beautiful reddish/violet hues toward the end of flowering, which makes it a very beautiful plant once it is covered in trichomes with the colors of fall: an amazing sight.

<span class=""product-title-hybrid"">Taste</span>
The aromas are very potent and pungent from the GMO with that very complex profile that ends with earthy-mossy notes, and combined with the citrusy and haze of our Lemon Queen,it gives a beautiful touch of freshness to the thick, oily smoke that will stay in mouth for an extended time and give you a strong body feeling first that will creep to your head and give a very couchlock effect.

<span class=""product-title-hybrid"">Description</span>
The Super Lemon Haze x GMO is a very exciting plant for hash lovers and sativa smokers. We combined two sativa dominant strain, one of which is our all-time classic Super Lemon Haze with its long and dense flowers covered in trichomes, and the second One being the GMO from Mamiko Seeds, one of the most different smells with its complex mix of garlic-onion-mushroom notes.

The mix of both resulted in a very strong and vigorous plant with dense, long and compact flowers with huge calyxes like the GMO, and a whole layer of trichomes covering the surface of the flowers will make it a very sticky plant. It is recommended to have a little bit of experience to grow this plant, as it has a pretty long flowering time to get the full expression of the plant and will require adequate feeding. Some of the most rewarding plants will take up to 11 weeks, but the result is worth the wait, with strong thick stems shooting flower sites everywhere.

The Super Lemon Haze x RS11 is a cross of our all-time winning strain, the Super Lemon Haze with the very popular strain RS11 (Rainbow Sherbert), bred by DeoFarm and selected by Doja and Wizard Trees, a very exclusive USA cut that has won a lot of fame for its very fruity taste.

The mix of both strains is a plant that will grow in a beautiful Christmas tree shape with medium internoedal growth and stems that could need some support by the end of flowering, depending on how tall you grow the plant. The flowers will have a beautiful roundish shape with slightly pointy tops, and a strong fruity and sour aroma coming out of the plant every time you touch it, and a very compact flower with thin calyxes and pistils. A very esthetic flower with great bag appeal and very easy to trim. The plant will tend to get some red and blue tones by the end of flowering, which makes it even more beautiful.

64084,"Banjerine Auto Flowering - 8 seed pk","Bred and produced by Atlas Seed, this strain falls in the Tropical / Floral family with aromas of tangerine and citrus. This strain exudes orange citrus notes with the utmost voracity. Many phenos will have aroma profiles closer to mandarin and tangerine, with even a hint of fuel. It is incredibly vigorous and very uniform. The banjo terps transfer exceptionally well into extracts as well as dried flowers. We have also seen above-average yields on washing this strain. The cross with Cotton Candy allows this semi-full term to be harvested reliably in September or March (depending on the hemisphere) when sown at the correct time–we recommend seeding beginning to mid May for transplanting at the beginning to mid June",,"2025-07-25 17:51:44",product,banjerine-auto-flowering-8-seed-pk,https://hmoonhydro.com/product/banjerine-auto-flowering-8-seed-pk/,"Cannabis Seed","Atlas Seed","Cannabis Seeds","Atlas Seed",simple,visible,No,,No,,,instock,no,no,50.00,,,.25,3,4,.25,,,,50.00,no,no,,,,,,,'-1,'-1,,,no,none,zero-rate,0,,,0,0,,,0,"{""focus"":{""keyphrase"":"""",""score"":0,""analysis"":{""keyphraseInTitle"":{""score"":0,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1}}},""additional"":[]}","{""analysis"":{""basic"":{""metadescriptionLength"":[],""lengthContent"":{""score"":-10,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isInternalLink"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""isExternalLink"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":3},""title"":{""titleLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":1},""readability"":{""contentHasAssets"":{""error"":1,""score"":1,""maxScore"":5},""paragraphLength"":{""score"":5,""maxScore"":5,""error"":0},""sentenceLength"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""passiveVoice"":{""score"":6,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""transitionWords"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""consecutiveSentences"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""subheadingsDistribution"":{""score"":9,""maxScore"":9,""error"":0},""calculateFleschReading"":{""score"":3,""maxScore"":9,""error"":1},""errors"":4}}}",58,,,default,,,,default,,,0,,,default,,,default,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,'-1,'-1,large,,,default,,"{""blockGraphs"":[],""customGraphs"":[],""default"":{""data"":{""Article"":[],""Course"":[],""Dataset"":[],""FAQPage"":[],""Movie"":[],""Person"":[],""Product"":[],""ProductReview"":[],""Car"":[],""Recipe"":[],""Service"":[],""SoftwareApplication"":[],""WebPage"":[]},""graphName"":""ItemPage"",""isEnabled"":true},""graphs"":[]}",default,,https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Atlas-Seed-Banjerine-Auto-765x926-1.webp||https://hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/atlas.jpg,Atlas-Seed-Banjerine-Auto-765x926-1.webp||atlas.jpg,/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Atlas-Seed-Banjerine-Auto-765x926-1.webp||/home/wp_9dm4yz/hmoonhydro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/atlas.jpg,64085||63978,Atlas-Seed-Banjerine-Auto-765&#215;926||atlas,,,,,,,,,,,,5,yocina2,yocina2@gmail.com,michael,yocina,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,no,,no,bottom,,"{""h-moon-hydro.myshopify.com"":{""_w2s_shopify_product_id"":""8043101225034"",""_w2s_shopify_variant_id"":""42665841262666"",""status"":""imported""}}",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,publish,,,0,,,0,closed,"2025-07-25 17:51:46"

64121,"EtOH Pro REV2 Ethanol Botanical Extractor - Odorless Closed-Loop High Volume","“EtOH” is the scientific abbreviation for ethanol. It seemed perfect to use in the name of the second iteration of extraction equipment from ExtractCraft following the great success of the Source Turbo.  The EtOH PRO was born.  Even though The EtOH PRO is younger, it’s essentially the Source Turbo’s big brother.  They both do the same thing in performing ethanol extraction easily and safely, from botanical material like lavender, sandalwood, hops, and mushrooms to anything you’d like to use in culinary arts, scenting, smoking, vaping, and medicine making. Like the Source Turbo, the EtOH PRO produces incredible, high-quality concentrates but quickly does it in a much larger volume.

The EtOH PRO is an advanced extraction equipment with capabilities normally found only in a lab. It is designed to be the workhorse on a benchtop for small businesses or advanced hobbyists. The unit has a 4-liter liquid volume capacity, which equates to processing about a pound or more of dry botanical material.

We’ve developed some incredible science applications, including a utility patent and process patent for heat flux management that controls vacuum and heat via one control contained in this beauty. Internal vacuum generation and heat delivery tuned specifically for low-temperature ethanol evaporation push vapor from the loading kettle through an air-driven condenser and into a collection vessel where the reclaimed ethanol is collected. All that science, work, and control is accomplished by a technologically advanced system that requires only a single push of a green button.

<strong>HOW THE PROCESS OPERATES</strong>

The EtOH PRO performs the important operation of evaporating and purging ethanol in the ethanol extraction process. Traditionally, evaporation for at-home extraction has been accomplished by allowing ethanol to evaporate slowly for a couple of days or boiling it in an open atmosphere with high heat. Neither of those options is good because natural evaporation takes far too long, and boiling off ethanol with high heat destroys the most flavorful and aromatic elements of an extraction, thus destroying quality. Most concerning, both options fill the surrounding air with combustible fumes, which is wasteful and dangerous. The EtOH PRO is designed to address and eliminate those problems.

The EtOH PRO is a fully contained closed-loop system that solves old ethanol evaporation problems without cumbersome, difficult-to-use, expensive lab equipment. Vacuum technology and advanced systems control the evaporation of ethanol away from the soon-to-be concentrate at around 100°F and safely collect it for reuse. The very low operational temperatures preserve the most delicate attributes of an extraction, creating the most high-quality, potent oil possible. Reclaiming ethanol for reuse keeps the dangerous fumes from filling the surroundings, saves significant money with every use, eliminates waste, and contributes greatly to sustainability. When the extraction process is completed, the pure oil concentrate remains in the Kettle, and the clean reclaimed ethanol is separated in the collector.

<strong>WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EtOH PRO AND OTHER DEVICES?</strong>

<strong>Extraction vs Infusion</strong>

A common question is, “What’s the difference between the EtOH PRO and other butter makers and infusion devices?” The difference is enormous; to understand this, we must differentiate between “infusion” and “extraction.”  “Infusion” is the act of soaking botanical matter in a large amount of butter or carrier oil (like olive oil) to absorb the botanical oil contained in the plant.  Regardless of claims to the contrary, the butter makers and infusion machines only perform the simple act of infusion, resulting in a large volume of the fat-based carrier with a comparably low potency end product. The exact process can be safely and easily accomplished on the stovetop, in a slow cooker, or any combination of a vessel and heat source. Infusion devices don’t concentrate oil or butter in any way. Instead, they merely steep the plant material like a slow cooker, allowing the added butter or oil to absorb the oils from it, leaving the user with no control over potency.

“Extraction” is entirely different, harvesting only pure oil from botanicals without added carrier oil, butter, or fat. The user extracts only pure botanical oils. Highly potent, pure concentrates result only from extraction, and the EtOH PRO is a great tool for doing that.  Pure oil from extraction is the base for any form of concentrate: tincture, concentrated tincture, absolute oil, wax, budder, pull-n-snap, shatter, edibles, topicals, and more.  Moreover, using concentrates for cooking provides a substantially cleaner and delicious end product and the ultimate control of potency.  A larger amount of concentrate can be combined with a small amount of butter to make it ungodly potent, or less can be added to a larger amount of butter to ease the strength as much as desired. The EtOH PRO delivers great versatility to safely make high-quality concentrates from any botanical, in any form or potency, creating a level of freedom and agility infusion devices can only dream of.

<strong>Ethanol Extraction Systems: Open vs. Closed Loop vs. Vacuum Assisted Closed Loop</strong>

How ethanol is boiled, evaporated, and, in some cases, recaptured for re-use is determined by the type of system being used. An <strong>“open”</strong> system boils ethanol by applying heat and evaporating the vapor into the open air. Examples of this are old-school methods like using a pot on a hot plate or a rice cooker. Open evaporation causes many obvious safety, quality, and affordability problems. When performing extractions, safety is paramount, and evaporating ethanol into the air of an enclosed area is very dangerous since those fumes are combustible and will easily ignite. Quality is another problem resulting from the high temperature required to boil ethanol under normal ambient pressure. In an open system, ethanol boils at about 173°F, which is too high. It destroys the delicate and beautiful compounds that define a quality concentrate and chemically alters its makeup, limiting post-processing options. Hot plates, pots, and rice cookers are inexpensive, so many people mistakenly consider this the cheapest processing option; however, when all aspects of extraction are considered, there’s an affordability paradox that makes this process one of the most costly. The rice cooker may be inexpensive, but ethanol isn’t cheap, and letting it evaporate into the air is an enormous waste of money that adds up quickly. Next, the final product's quality, and hence the value, must be accounted for, and the high-temperature purge used in open systems will produce the lowest quality medication. Low-quality, less potent meds won’t go far, don’t last as long, and require you to use more overall, seriously decreasing value. Additionally, openly boiling ethanol requires constant attention and supervision, wasting valuable time you could spend doing something else important or relaxing. The low cost may make the rice cooker and other open system methods attractive to a home user,  but they’re unsafe, produce low-quality concentrates, and are not the most affordable option.

<strong>“Closed loop”</strong> systems also evaporate ethanol at open atmosphere temperatures of around 173°F, just like a rice cooker, but have the added ability to capture and reclaim some of the evaporated ethanol for reuse. The most popular of these devices are simple water distillers. They aren’t really closed loop because they vent into the open, but they are similar.  These devices partially solve two of the problems associated with completely open systems to a limited degree. Safety is better because a good amount of the alcohol vapor is captured, condensed, and collected for reuse. However, most of these devices drain into an open recovery vessel from condensers that get overwhelmed by the volume of hot vapor pushed through them, allowing a lot of vapor to escape into the open air.  This is a little safer but far from perfect. In my experience, the average ethanol reclaim with these is around 60%-70%. A water distiller can be more expensive than a rice cooker, but it’s a little safer and more affordable in the long term because the ethanol is recaptured for reuse.  Now for the bad news. These machines are designed for water distillation, not oil extraction, creating serious quality and operational problems. Extractions made using a distiller or a rice cooker suffer from the same quality limitations. Distillers also work under normal ambient pressure, so the operating temperatures are high, and the extract quality is low. It can also be frustrating because you can’t see inside during the process, and the oil must be removed from a fixed vat.  Using one is cumbersome, difficult to empty, dangerously hot, and wasteful. For an average at-home user, these units are quite large, with substantial surface area in the oil collection area, and are made to run large amounts of water, so if you need to run a small batch, you’ll have difficulties. Distillers are an acceptable choice if you’re only making large batches of oil and willing to sacrifice safety and quality for the production volume, but that’s all they’re capable of.
<div></div>
The most advanced systems are <strong>“Vacuum Assisted Closed Systems,”</strong> and this is where the EtOH PRO shines. Adding a vacuum to a closed system keeps all of the vapor activity enclosed within a self-contained unit, allowing virtually nothing to escape, and the low internal pressure allows the EtOH PRO to boil and evaporate ethanol at around 100°F. The ability to operate at low temperatures in an enclosed environment solves all the problems the other devices suffer from. It’s safe because everything is reclaimed internally, allowing no dangerous fumes or odors to escape during operation. In addition to vastly improved safety, the quality of the extractions and concentrates is unmatched. Using such low temperatures for the entire process ensures that all the good stuff extracted from the plant is saved, protected, and packed into the concentrate. The quality is so tasty, smooth, and potent that it’s unbelievable, and this high quality is key to great value. Higher quality, more potent medication will go further, last longer, and require you to use less overall, seriously increasing value and savings.

Contrary to many people’s first impression, the EtOH PRO is the most affordable option for at-home extraction, even with the higher initial cost. What must be understood about the EtOH PRO is that affordability and value are more than just a price tag. The EtOH PRO provides great money savings in ethanol with every use, safe and easy operation, wildly superior quality concentrates, a processing time of around 2 hours, and loads of fun experimenting with unlimited crafting possibilities.

64126,"Meet Source Turbo","The Source Turbo:

Helping people understand why the Source Turbo is special and why what it does is important is one of the most challenging missions ExtractCraft faces as a company. In general terms, the Source Turbo is an appliance that allows anyone to perform home ethanol extraction easily and safely, using botanical materials like lavender, sandalwood, hops, and mushrooms for anything you’d like to use in culinary arts, scenting, smoking, vaping, and medicine making. The Source Turbo produces incredible, high-quality concentrates that will amaze you from the first try.

More specifically, the Source Turbo is an advanced piece of extraction equipment with capabilities normally found only in a lab but designed to feel familiar in the home and fit comfortably on the kitchen counter. It is a combination of internal vacuum generation and heat delivery specifically tuned for low-temperature ethanol evaporation, incorporating an outer containment serving triple duty as a vacuum chamber, cold trap, and collection vessel controlled by a system so technologically advanced that operation requires only the push of a single green button.

The Source Turbo is designed for small-batch countertop extraction. The unit can be loaded with a liquid volume of about 300 ml. Depending on the material, that equates to processing about an ounce of dry material and producing a few grams of concentrate.  It’s perfect for the hobbyist or test kitchen.  It’s a lot of science bundled in a small package.

You can’t forget the app these days. The Source Turbo has a great mobile app to monitor estimated content temperature, vacuum level, current altitude setting, and time remaining until auto-shutoff. Using the app is optional and not required for the unit's operation, so those who don’t want to do so don’t have to.

The Source Turbo performs the important operation of evaporating and purging ethanol in the ethanol extraction process. Traditionally, evaporation for at-home extraction has been accomplished by allowing ethanol to evaporate slowly for a couple of days or boiling it in an open atmosphere with high heat. Neither of those options is good because natural evaporation takes far too long, and boiling off ethanol with high heat destroys the most flavorful and aromatic elements of an extraction, thus destroying quality. Most concerning, both options fill the surrounding air with combustible fumes, which is wasteful and dangerous. The Source Turbo is designed to address and eliminate those problems.

The Source Turbo is a self-contained closed-loop system that solves old ethanol evaporation problems without cumbersome, difficult-to-use, expensive lab equipment. Vacuum technology and advanced system controls evaporate ethanol around 100°F. The very low operational temperatures preserve the most delicate attributes of an extraction, creating the most high-quality, potent oil possible. Using a combination of vacuum, heat, and outside ambient temperature, the vacuum chamber becomes a “cold-trap” and collection vessel to reclaim evaporated ethanol for reuse. Reclaiming ethanol for reuse keeps the dangerous fumes from filling the surroundings, saves significant money with every use, and eliminates waste. When the extraction process is completed, the pure oil concentrate remains in the crucible, and the clean reclaimed ethanol is separated in the collector.","<strong>Ethanol Extraction Systems: Open vs. Closed Loop vs. Vacuum Assisted Closed Loop</strong>
