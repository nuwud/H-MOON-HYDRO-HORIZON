Only a few of them include: fogging or misting, spray stakes or drip system timing, air pumps, CO2 equipment and intake or exhaust fan control. The CycleStat may be set for interval and cycle of timed events. Interval is the time between the ""on"" and ""off"" cycles. The interval knob may be set from 5 minutes to 8 hours. Set this for desired time between functions. Cycle is the length of time that a specific function or condition must be maintained. Cycle may be set from 5 seconds to 30 minutes.  <p>  Automatic reset feature allows function synchronizing with other system controls. Turn the switch off and on again for manual operation. The CycleStat 4P has a built-in photosensor to defeat timing during darkness hours. Photosensor may be switched in or out as desired.
