## Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Malformed CSV Rows
**Symptom**: 33 products missing titles, 53 missing prices  
**Root Cause**: Description fragments split across multiple rows (e.g., "Dosage", "Increased yields")  
**Solution**: Created `deep_clean_csv.js` to filter rows where Handle doesn't match `/^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$/`  
**Result**: Removed 37 malformed rows

### Problem 2: Missing Prices
**Symptom**: 14 products with empty Variant Price  
**Root Cause**: WooCommerce grouped products with child-only pricing  
**Solution**: Created `fix_missing_prices.js` with price lookup from WooCommerce export  
**Result**: All 1193 products now have valid prices
